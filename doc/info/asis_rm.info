1 About This Manual
*******************

This Manual contains reference material for developers using
ASIS-for-GNAT -- GNAT's implementation of the Ada Semantic Interface
Specification (ASIS).  It provides information about ASIS-for-GNAT's
implementation-specific characteristics and current implementation
limitations.  (The term 'implementation-specific' in ASIS means what is
called 'implementation-defined' in the Ada Reference Manual.)

ASIS has been designed as a portable basis for many kinds of Ada code
analysis tools. However, for situations where a developer may need to
exploit the characteristics of a particular Ada compiler, ASIS also
contains a number of implementation-specific features.  These allow
interfacing with the underlying Ada implementation, as well as
exploiting the implementation permissions for particular queries.

Of course, any ASIS application that uses implementation-specific
features may be nonportable. You should follow good programming
practice and isolate and clearly document any sections of your program
that make use of such features in a nonportable manner.

`What This Manual Contains'

This manual contains the following chapters:

   * *note ASIS-for-GNAT and the ASIS Standard: 5, describes the
     relationship between ASIS-for-GNAT and the existing ASIS
     International Standard.

   * *note ASIS Extensions: 6, describes the contents of the packages
     `Asis.Extensions', `Asis.Extensions.Flat_Kinds' and
     `Asis.Extensions.Iterator'.

   * *note Implementation-Specific Features and Implementation
     Permissions: 7, presents the aspects of the ASIS definition that
     are implementation specific and describes their treatment in
     ASIS-for-GNAT.

   * *note Debugging Information: 8, describes the kinds of debugging
     information that you can generate with ASIS-for-GNAT.

`What You Should Know Before Reading This Manual'

This Reference Manual assumes that you are familiar with Ada 95
language as defined by the International Standard ISO/IEC-8652:1995, and
with ASIS 95 as defined by the ASIS 95 International Standard ISO/IEC
15291:1999.

This Manual supplements the information presented in the ASIS-for-GNAT
User's Guide and uses the terminology introduced there.

2 ASIS-for-GNAT and the ASIS Standard
*************************************

ASIS-for-GNAT implements ASIS 95 and contains several extensions (see
*note ASIS Extensions: 6.) as allowed by the ASIS Standard, Section
1.1.3.1.

The differences between the GNAT and standard ASIS are that
ASIS-for-GNAT:

   * includes GNAT-specific comment headers at the beginning of each
     source file;

   * supplies additional context clauses;

   * defines the packages' private parts;

   * is formatted to comply with GNAT coding style;

   * declares the `Is_Dispatching_Operation' query in
     `Asis.Declarations' rather than in `Asis.Expressions'.

     This query has `A_Declaration' `Element' as its argument and,
     according to the general principles of the ASIS package hierarchy,
     it should be in the `Asis.Declarations' spec;

   * for the optional Data Decomposition Annex, the package
     `Asis.Data_Decomposition.Portable_Transfer' is not provided;

   * includes extensions that support features introduced in Ada 2005.

3 ASIS Extensions
*****************

ASIS-for-GNAT provides some additional types and queries as ASIS
extensions.  All these queries are defined and documented in the
hierarchy headed by package `Asis.Extensions'. They are referred as
'ASIS extensions' or 'ASIS extension queries' below.

All the ASIS extensions obey the general ASIS rules:

   * When using ASIS extensions, you have to follow the required
     sequencing of calls

   * Only ASIS-defined exceptions propagate outside ASIS extension
     queries

If the documentation of an ASIS extension query contains a list of
'appropriate' `Element' kinds, then the query can be applied only to
`Element's from this list, and it raises `ASIS_Inappropriate_Element'
with `Value_Error' status otherwise. If the documentation of an ASIS
extension query contains a list of 'expected' element kinds, then the
query can be applied to an `Element' having any kind, but it returns a
meaningful result only for `Element's from this list.

The current set of ASIS extensions originated from the ASIS
implementation needs and from the development of some ASIS tools inside
the ASIS-for-GNAT team. The `Asis.Extensions' hierarchy is not
necessarily frozen: some further extension queries may be added, and
suggestions from ASIS application developers are welcome.

Note that some of the ASIS extensions are implemented as ASIS `secondary
queries' -- that is, the implementation of such a query is a sequence of
primary ASIS queries. Some other extensions are `pure extensions'; that
is, their implementation is based on direct access to GNAT's internal
data structures.

3.1 `Asis.Extensions'
=====================

This package, whose spec is located in the file `asis-extensions.ads',
contains the declarations of various ASIS extensions, including dynamic
`Element' and `Compilation_Unit' list types, placeholder actual
parameters for `Asis.Iterator.Traverse_Element', additional `Element'
structural and semantic queries, queries that return information about
the status of the source file for a `Compilation_Unit', queries
returning the (images of the) values of static expressions, etc.

3.2 `Asis.Extensions.Flat_Kinds'
================================

The ASIS `Element' classification hierarchy is based on a set of Ada
enumeration types, each corresponding to a 'level' in the hierarchy.
The package `Asis.Extensions.Flat_Kinds', whose spec is located in the
file `asis-extensions-flat_kinds.ads', defines the enumeration type
`Flat_Element_Kinds'; this type combines the values of all these types
and thus provides a 'flat' view onto the syntactic `Element'
classification.


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: Asis Extensions Iterator,  Prev: Asis Extensions Flat_Kinds,  Up: ASIS Extensions

3.3 `Asis.Extensions.Iterator'
==============================

This package, whose spec is located in the file
`asis-extensions-iterator.ads', contains the declarations of
`Traverse_Unit' generic procedure that is a generalization of the
standard ASIS `Asis.Iterator.Traverse_Element' iterator.
`Traverse_Unit' provides the depth-first traversal of the whole
syntactical structure of the ASIS Compilation Unit.

4 Implementation-Specific Features and Implementation Permissions
*****************************************************************

ASIS permits four kinds of implementation-specific behavior.

First, ASIS subprograms that define an interface between an ASIS
implementation and the underlying Ada implementation have
implementation-specific parameters. There are three such queries --
`Asis.Implementation.Initialize', `Asis.Implementation.Finalize' and
`Asis.Ada_Environments.Associate'.

Each has a string parameter named `Parameters' with an
implementation-specific meaning. The meaning of the `Parameters' string
in ASIS-for-GNAT is discussed in *note Interacting with the Underlying
Ada Implementation: 12.

Second, in some areas the ASIS standard explicitly grants the
implementation permission to provide restricted functionality;
generally this allows omitting features that could present considerable
implementation difficulty.  Such permissions usually affect more than
one ASIS query.  The ASIS package `Asis.Implementation.Permissions'
contains boolean queries identifying the choices made by a given ASIS
implementation.  The ASIS-for-GNAT approach to these implementation
permissions is discussed in *note Implementation Permissions: 13.

Third, the ASIS standard defines specific implementation permissions
for some queries.  Also, the result of a query may be implementation
specific because of the nature of the query.  See *note ASIS Queries
Having Specific Implementation Permissions or Implementation-Specific
Results: 14.

Finally, ASIS-for-GNAT provides special `Context' manipulation
mechanisms that supplement those defined in the ASIS standard.  These
additional `Context' modes may be useful for some ASIS applications.

4.1 Interacting with the Underlying Ada Implementation
======================================================

This section describes how to use the `Parameters' string to pass
implementation-specific information to several ASIS subprograms.

* Menu:

* Format of the Parameters String::
* Parameters of Asis.Implementation.Initialize: Parameters of Asis Implementation Initialize.
* Parameters of Asis.Implementation.Finalize: Parameters of Asis Implementation Finalize.
* Parameters of Asis.Ada_Environments.Associate: Parameters of Asis Ada_Environments Associate.


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: Format of the Parameters String,  Next: Parameters of Asis Implementation Initialize,  Up: Interacting with the Underlying Ada Implementation

4.1.1 Format of the `Parameters' String
---------------------------------------

A `Parameters' string is passed to three ASIS subprograms:
`Asis.Implementation.Initialize', `Asis.Implementation.Finalize', and
`Asis.Ada_Environments.Associate'.

The `Parameters' string comprises substrings delimited by separators.
The substrings are called `parameters' (with lower-case 'p') below.  A
separator is a non-empty string comprising characters from the set
<Space>, <LF>, and <CR>.  There may be 0 or more parameters in a
`Parameters' string, and there may be separators before the first
and/or after the last parameter.

Each of the queries `Asis.Implementation.Initialize',
`Asis.Implementation.Finalize', and `Asis.Ada_Environments.Associate'
has specific rules for the format of its parameters.  If some parameter
is not well-formed, then either a warning message is generated or else
the `ASIS_Failed' exception is raised with the `Parameter_Error' status.
The descriptions below explain the situations where `ASIS_Failed' is
raised.


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: Parameters of Asis Implementation Initialize,  Next: Parameters of Asis Implementation Finalize,  Prev: Format of the Parameters String,  Up: Interacting with the Underlying Ada Implementation

4.1.2 Parameters of `Asis.Implementation.Initialize'
----------------------------------------------------

The allowed parameters for `Asis.Implementation.Initialize' are as
follows:

`-d<flag>'
     The specific ASIS-for-GNAT debug flag named `<flag>' is set ON

`-dall'
     All the ASIS-for-GNAT debug flags are set ON

`-k'
     Keep going even if an internal implementation error is detected.
     When a non-ASIS exception is raised, it is replaced by raising
     `ASIS_Failed' with `Unhandled_Exception_Error' status (this is the
     only case when `Unhandled_Exception_Error' is set) and the
     `Diagnosis' string containing the name and the message from the
     non-ASIS exception originally raised

`-nbb'
     No bug box. Do not output to `Standard_Error' the bug box
     containing the description of the internal implementation bug.
     Implies `-k'

`-sv'
     Set the strong GNAT/ASIS version check when reading the tree files

`-wv'
     Set the weak GNAT/ASIS version check when reading the tree files

`-we'
     All ASIS warnings are treated as errors.

     When execution reaches the point where the warning would occur,
     the `ASIS_Failed' exception is raised; the warning message is the
     ASIS `Diagnosis' string.

`-ws'
     All ASIS warning messages are suppressed.

The `<flag>' value for the `-d' parameter may be any lower case letter
from `a' through `z' or any digit from `0' through `9', although not
all of the 36 possible flags are implemented.  For more information,
refer to the documentation in the source file `a4g-a_debug.adb'.  See
also *note ASIS Debug Flags: 1a.

If more then one parameter controlling the warning mode is set in the
`Parameters' string, all but the last one are ignored.

4.1.3 Parameters of `Asis.Implementation.Finalize'
--------------------------------------------------

No parameters are allowed for `Asis.Implementation.Finalize'.

`Asis.Implementation.Finalize' resets all the general ASIS-for-GNAT
parameters to their default values (that is, all the debug flags are
set OFF, and the warning mode is set to the default warning mode).


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: Parameters of Asis Ada_Environments Associate,  Prev: Parameters of Asis Implementation Finalize,  Up: Interacting with the Underlying Ada Implementation

4.1.4 Parameters of `Asis.Ada_Environments.Associate'
-----------------------------------------------------

The following parameters are allowed:

`-C1'
     The `Context' comprises a single tree file, whose name is given as
     the next parameter in the `Parameters' string.

`-CN'
     The `Context' comprises a set of one or more tree files, whose
     names are given as the next set of parameters in the `Parameters'
     string.

`-CA'
     The `Context' comprises all the tree files in the tree search path.

`-FS'
     All the trees considered as making up a given `Context' are created
     'on the fly', whether or not the corresponding tree file already
     exists.  Once created, a tree file then is reused as long as the
     `Context' remains open.

`-FT'
     Only pre-created trees are used; no tree files are created by ASIS.

`-FM'
     Mixed approach: if a needed tree does not exist, an attempt is
     made to create it 'on the fly'.

`-SA'
     Source files for all the `Compilation_Unit's belonging to the
     `Context' (except the predefined `Standard' package) are
     considered in the consistency check when opening the `Context'.

`-SE'
     Only existing source files for all the `Compilation_Units'
     belonging to the `Context' are considered in the consistency check
     when opening the `Context'.

`-SN'
     No source files from the underlying file system are taken into
     account when checking the consistency of the set of tree files
     making up the `Context'.

`-I<dir>'
     Defines the directory in which to search for source files when
     compiling sources to create a tree 'on the fly'.

`--GCC=compiler_name'
     Defines the program to be called to create the tree on the fly

`-gnatec<file>'
     Defines the additional configuration file to be used when calling
     GNAT to create the tree on the fly for `-FS' or `-FM' Context

`-gnatA'
     Avoid processing `gnat.adc' when calling GNAT to create the tree
     on the fly for `-FS' or `-FM' Context

`-T<dir>'
     Defines the directory in which to search for a tree file.

`<file_name>'
     Defines the name of a tree file (used in conjunction with `-C1' or
     `-CN').

For the `-I' and `-T' parameters, `<dir>' should denote an existing
directory in the underlying file system. The '.' and '..'  notations
are allowed, as well as relative or absolute directory names.  If
`<dir>' does not denote an existing directory, `ASIS_Failed' with
`Parameter_Error' status is raised.

For ASIS `-FS' or `-FM' Context, Context parameters `-I', `-gnatec' and
`-gnatA' are passed to the GNAT call to create the tree on the fly and
these parameters have exactly the same meaning as they have for GNAT.

A tree file name given by a `<file_name>' parameter may or may not
contain directory information.

Any relative directory name or file name containing relative directory
information should start from '.' or '..'.

If a directory or a file name used as a part of some Context parameter
contains space characters, this name should be quoted.

The search path associated with an ASIS `Context' consists of the
directories listed as parameters for the
`Asis.Ada_Environments.Associate' query, in the same order as they are
included in the actual `Parameters' string.  The ASIS source search
path consists only of the directories following `-I', and the ASIS tree
search path consists only of the directories following `-T'. If no
source (tree) directories are present in the value of the `Parameters'
string, then the ASIS source (tree) search path consists of the current
directory only.  Otherwise the current directory is included in the
ASIS search path if and only if it is set explicitly as `-I.' or `-T.'
respectively.

If an ASIS `Context' is associated with an `-FS' or `-FM' option, the
`Context' source search path is used to locate sources of the units for
which tree files need to be created, and to locate other source files
needed during compilation. For example, if we have:

    Asis.Ada_Environments.Associate
      (My_Context,
      "My_Context_Name",
      "-CA -FS -I./dir -I.");

then, when processing a call:

    My_Unit := Asis.Compilation_Units.Library_Unit_Declaration
                ("Foo", My_Context);

ASIS first tries to locate the source file `foo.ads' in `./dir', and if
this attempt fails, it tries to locate it in the current directory. If
there is no such file in the current directory, ASIS continues the
search by looking into the directories listed in the value of
`ADA_INCLUDE_PATH' environment variable. If the source file is found
(say in the current directory), ASIS creates the tree file by calling
the compiler:

    $ gcc -c -gnatc -gnatt -I./dir -I. -I- foo.ads

If an ASIS `Context' is associated with `-CA' option, then, when this
`Context' is opened, ASIS processes all the tree files located in the
tree search path associated with the `Context'.

The following further rules define the required combinations of
parameters in the actual `Parameters' string:

   * `-C1' and `-CN' require `-FT'

   * `-FS' and `-FM' require `-SA'

In case an incompatible combination is set, `ASIS_Failed' with
`Parameter_Error' status is raised.

If the actual `Parameters' string passed to `Associate' contains no
parameters, the default parameters are `-CA', `-FT', and `-SA'.

The `-FS' and `-FM' options define `dynamic Context modes'; they allow
the content of a `Context' (that is, the set of ASIS
`Compilation_Unit's contained in the `Context') to be changed while the
`Context' is open. See *note Dynamic Context Modes: 1d. for more
details.

For the `Name' parameter of the `Asis.Ada_Environments.Associate'
query, any string can be passed as an actual parameter.  No
verification is performed on the contents, and no semantics are
associated with this parameter.

4.2.2 Processing Implicit `Element's
------------------------------------

ASIS `Element's represent both explicit and implicit components of Ada
programs.  (An example of an implicit construct is an inherited
subprogram of a derived type.)  Some ASIS queries can return implicit
`Element's (that is, `Element's representing implicit Ada constructs).
Any syntactic or semantic query should accept an implicit `Element' as
an `Element' parameter, but the ASIS Standard allows an implementation
not to support implicit `Element's at all, or to support them only
partially. If an implementation does not support the implicit `Element'
representing a particular kind of construct, then an ASIS query that is
supposed to process this implicit `Element' should return either a
`Nil_Element' or a `Nil_Element_List' depending on whether the query
returns a single `Element' or an `Element_List'.

Implicit `Element's are partially supported by ASIS-for-GNAT.

ASIS-for-GNAT supports implicit `Element's for the following constructs:

   * Derived user-defined subprograms

   * Derived enumeration literals

   * Derived record components

ASIS-for-GNAT does not support implicit `Element's representing
implicit declarations of predefined type operations (such as '`=', or
the '`+' operation for numeric types).


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: Processing Several Contexts at a Time,  Next: Implementation-Defined Types and Values,  Prev: Processing Implicit Elements,  Up: Implementation Permissions

4.2.3 Processing Several Contexts at a Time
-------------------------------------------

According to the ASIS Standard, the number of ASIS `Context's that can
be associated and opened at a time, as well as the number of ASIS
`Compilation_Unit's that can be processed at a time, are implementation
specific.  ASIS-for-GNAT does not impose any restriction on the number
of `Context's opened at the same time, or on the number of
`Compilation_Unit's that can be obtained from all the opened
`Context's, as long as the application does not go beyond general
system resource limitations.

However, for a `Context' associated with an `-FS' or `-FM' option, all
the trees created 'on the fly' while obtaining `Compilation_Unit's from
this `Context' are placed in the current directory. If the current
directory also contains some tree files belonging to another `Context',
the latter may become corrupted. To process more than one `Context'
safely, an application should have at most one `Context' associated
with the `-FS' or `-FM' option. Moreover, if among `Context's processed
at the same time there is one that can create trees 'on the fly', then
the other `Context's should not use tree files located in the current
directory.


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: Implementation-Defined Types and Values,  Prev: Processing Several Contexts at a Time,  Up: Implementation Permissions

4.2.4 Implementation-Defined Types and Values
---------------------------------------------

All the implementation-defined types, subtypes and values depend on the
subtype `Implementation_Defined_Integer_Type' and on the
`Implementation_Defined_Integer_Constant' defined in package `Asis'.
ASIS-for-GNAT's declarations for these entities are the same as in the
ASIS Standard:

    subtype Implementation_Defined_Integer_Type is Integer;
    Implementation_Defined_Integer_Constant : constant := 2**31-1;

All the ASIS (sub)types used as list indexes for ASIS array types have
`Implementation_Defined_Integer_Constant' as an upper bound.

        * If `-FS' is also set, nothing is done.

        * If the `-FT' or `-FM' is set, all the tree files (that is,
          files having `.adt' suffix) in the tree search path
          associated with the `Context' are processed.  ASIS reads in
          each tree file and checks that it was created with the
          `-gnatc' option. Tree files that cannot be read in or that
          were not created with the `-gnatc' option are ignored.  For
          each other tree ASIS collects some 'black-box' information
          about the `Compilation_Unit's that it represents, and
          performs a consistency check for every unit it encounters in
          the tree (see ASIS-for-GNAT User's Guide for a discussion of
          the consistency problem). If any consistency check fails,
          `ASIS_Failed' is raised and the `Context' remains closed.


   * For a `Context' associated with a `-C1' or `-CN' option, ASIS
     processes all the tree files associated with the `Context',
     collecting 'black-box' information and performing consistency
     checks for all the encountered Compilation Units.  If for any
     reason a tree file cannot be successfully read in for a `Context'
     associated with a `-C1' option, `ASIS_Failed' is raised and the
     `Context' remains closed.  If a tree read fails for a `Context'
     associated with a `-CN' option, an ASIS warning is generated and
     the `Context' opening process continues.  If any consistency check
     fails, `ASIS_Failed' is raised and the `Context' remains closed.


`ASIS 9' `package Asis.Ada_Environments.Containers'

   * ASIS-for-GNAT supports the trivial `Container' model. Every
     `Context' contains exactly one `Container', whose content and name
     are the same as its enclosing `Context'

`ASIS 10' `package Asis.Compilation_Units'

ASIS 10.3  `function Unit_Origin'

   * `A_Predefined_Unit' origin is returned for those compilation units
     listed in RM95, Annex A(2), and only for these units.

   * `An_Implementation_Unit' origin is returned for compilation units
     that are the components of the GNAT Run-Time Library, but that are
     not listed in RM95, Annex A(2).

   * `An_Application_Unit' origin is returned for all other compilation
     units.


ASIS 10.6 `function Library_Unit_Declaration' and ASIS 10.7 `function
Compilation_Unit_Body'

   * When processing a `Context' associated with an `-FS' or `-FM'
     option, if ASIS cannot find a needed unit in the tree files that
     have been already processed, it tries to create the needed tree by
     locating the source of the unit and compiling it 'on the fly'. If
     this attempt fails for any reason, `Nil_Compilation_Unit' is
     returned.

ASIS 10.13 `function Corresponding_Declaration'

   * ASIS-for-GNAT does not make use of ASIS `Compilation_Unit's of
     `An_Unknown_Unit' kind.

   * If an argument is of `A_Public_Declaration_And_Body' class,
     `Nil_Compilation_Unit' is returned.

ASIS 10.14 `function Corresponding_Body'

   * ASIS-for-GNAT does not make use of ASIS `Compilation_Unit's of
     `An_Unknown_Unit' kind.

ASIS 10.22 `function Can_Be_Main_Program'

   * For GNAT, any parameterless library procedure and any
     parameterless library function returning a result of an integer
     type is classified by this  query as a (possible) main subprogram
     for a partition.

   * If for such a library subprogram both spec and body exist as ASIS
     `Compilation_Unit's retrievable from a given ASIS `Context', both
     are considered as  `Can_Be_Main_Program'.

ASIS 10.24 `function Text_Name'

   * This function returns the name of the source file containing the
     source of `Compilation_Unit'. This name may or may not contain a
     prefix denoting the directory in the underlying file system.  If
     present, the directory may be given in absolute or relative form,
     depending on the command line options that were used for the call
     to GNAT that created the corresponding tree file.

   * This function does not check the existence of the corresponding
     source file in the underlying file system, it just reflects the
     situation which was in effect when the corresponding tree file was
     created. Thus, if you delete or move the corresponding source file
     after creating the tree, the full file name returned by this
     function will be incorrect.

   * Use the query `Asis.Extensions.Source_File_Status' to get the
     information about the current status of the source file for a
     `Compilation_Unit'.

ASIS 10.25 `function Text_Form'

   * In the GNAT compilation model all source files are ordinary text
     files in the underlying file system. Therefore this function
     always returns a `Nil_Asis_String' to indicate that `Text_IO.Open'
     uses the default options for manipulating Ada sources.

ASIS 10.26 `function Object_Name'

   * Returns a null string. In the GNAT environment, creating an object
     file has no connection with creating trees for ASIS.

ASIS 10.27 `function Object_Form'

   * Returns a null string.

ASIS 10.29 `function Has_Attribute'

   * Returns `False'. ASIS-for-GNAT does not provide any additional
     attributes for Compilation Units.

ASIS 10.30 `function Attribute_Value_Delimiter'

   * Returns a wide string of length one containing the `LF' wide
     character.

ASIS 10.31 `function Attribute_Values'

   * A null string is returned.

`ASIS 11' `package Asis.Compilation_Units.Times'

ASIS 11.2  `function Time_Of_Last_Update'

   * This function returns the time stamp (the time of the latest
     change) of the corresponding source file. The corresponding source
     file is the source file whose name is returned by
     `Asis.Compilation_Units.Text_Name'.

ASIS 11.3  `function Compilation_CPU_Duration'

   * This function always returns zero duration, because the CPU
     compilation duration concept does not apply to ASIS-for-GNAT

ASIS 11.4  `function Attribute_Time'

   * This function always returns `Nil_ASIS_Time' because ASIS-for-GNAT
     does not provide any `Compilation_Unit' attributes

`ASIS 13' `package Asis.Elements'

ASIS 13.3  `function Context_Clause_Elements'

   * This function returns exactly those clauses and pragmas that are
     in the source for the unit.

   * Returns `Nil_Element_List' if the argument unit is of
     `A_Nonexistent_Declaration', `A_Nonexistent_Body' or
     `An_Unknown_Unit' kind

   * Returns `Nil_Element_List' for the predefined package `Standard'.
     For all other predefined Ada compilation units, returns their
     context clauses as they appear in the sources held in the GNAT
     Run-Time Library.

ASIS 13.4  `function Configuration_Pragmas'

   * This function always returns `Nil_Element_List', because in the
     GNAT compilation environment "a list of pragmas that apply to all
     future compilation_unit elements compiled into `The_Context'"
     essentially depends on the GNAT options set when compiling a unit
     (in particular the `-gnatA' and `-gnatec' options), and this
     cannot be determined from the content of the given `Context'.

ASIS 13.5  `function Compilation_Pragmas'

   * If the argument unit has been compiled on its own to produce a
     corresponding tree file, then the result contains the
     configuration pragmas from the GNAT configuration file(s) involved
     in this compilation. Otherwise  (that is, if the argument unit has
     been compiled only as an effect of compiling some other unit), the
     result contains only those pragmas that belong to the unit's
     source file.

   * A pragma that appears in the unit's context clause is included in
     the result list only if it is a configuration pragma.

   * Returns `Nil_Element_List' for the predefined package `Standard'.

ASIS 13.31 `function Is_Equal'

   * Two elements representing configuration pragmas belonging to
     `A_Configuration_Compilation' unit (or components thereof) are
     considered as being equal only if they are created by the same
     compilation (belong to the same tree).

ASIS 13.36 `function Enclosing_Element'

   * ASIS-for-GNAT does not require the `Element_Context' parameter.
     The `Enclosing_Element' function with two parameters just calls the
     `Enclosing_Element' function with one parameter for its `Element'
     parameter.

`ASIS 15' `package Asis.Declarations'

ASIS 15.24 `function Body_Block_Statement'

   * If the body passed as the actual parameter has no declarative
     items of its own,  `Asis.Statements.Is_Declare_Block' returns
     `False'.

`ASIS 18' `package Asis.Statements'

ASIS 18.14 `function Is_Declare_Block'

   * If the argument represents the dummy block statement created by
     `Asis.Declarations.Body_Block_Statement' function, the result will
     be `True' if and only if the corresponding body has declarative
     items.

`ASIS 20' `package Asis.Text'

ASIS 20.1 `type Line'

   * Lines in ASIS-for-GNAT do not contain any end-of-line characters
     (see RM95, 2.2(2)).

ASIS 20.22 `function Delimiter_Image'

   * Returns a wide string of length one, containing the `LF' wide
     character.

4.4 Processing of Predefined Input-Output Packages
==================================================

The GNAT compiler transforms the structure of the predefined
input-output packages (`Ada.Text_IO', `Ada.Wide_Text_IO' and
`Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO') to optimize compilations of their clients.
The documentation of `Ada.Text_IO' says:

    --  Note: the generic subpackages of Text_IO (Integer_IO, Float_IO, Fixed_IO,
    --  Modular_IO, Decimal_IO and Enumeration_IO) appear as private children in
    --  GNAT. These children are with'ed automatically if they are referenced, so
    --  this rearrangement is invisible to user programs, but has the advantage
    --  that only the needed parts of Text_IO are processed and loaded.

The same happens for `Ada.Wide_Text_IO' and `Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO'.
In this situation ASIS follows not the Ada Standard, but the actual code
contained in the GNAT Run-Time Library. That is, the
`Enclosing_Compilation_Unit' for an ASIS `Element' representing
`Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO' will be not the `Compilation_Unit' that
contains the whole package `Ada.Text_IO', but the `Compilation_Unit'
representing its private child as it is described above.

The `Asis.Extensions' package contains a query named
`Is_Sub_Package_Implemented_As_Child_Unit' that allows to detect such
private children of predefined Ada text input-output packages.


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: Representation clauses and -gnatI GNAT option,  Next: Dynamic Context Modes,  Prev: Processing of Predefined Input-Output Packages,  Up: Implementation-Specific Features and Implementation Permissions

4.5 Representation clauses and `-gnatI' GNAT option
===================================================

GNAT `-gnatI' allows to ignore all the representation clauses in the
code being compiled. This allows to compile the code if it contains
representation clauses that are illegal in the given compilation
environment. ASIS can process tree files created with `-gnatI', and for
the ASIS `Context' that is based on such trees, ASIS does not yield
`Elements' that correspond to representation clauses.

Note that you will see these representation clauses in the text images
of the enclosing `Elements', but nevertheless you will not be able to
get them as subcomponents of such `Elements'.


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: Dynamic Context Modes,  Prev: Representation clauses and -gnatI GNAT option,  Up: Implementation-Specific Features and Implementation Permissions

4.6 Dynamic `Context' Modes
===========================

If an ASIS `Context' is defined with an `-FS' or `-FM' option, then
ASIS may compile sources 'on the fly' to obtain `Compilation_Unit's.
Thus the content of the `Context' will not necessarily remain frozen
when the `Context' is open -- when ASIS gets a new `Compilation_Unit',
it 'adds' it to the `Context'.  The `-FS' and `-FM' options are
referred to as `dynamic Context modes'.

The difference between the two modes is as follows:

`-FS'
     ASIS does not take into account any existing tree file when
     opening a `Context'.

`-FM'
     ASIS first processes the tree files in the tree search path.  If a
     given `Compilation_Unit' is present in the existing set of tree
     files, these tree files are used; otherwise ASIS tries to locate
     the source of the unit and to compile it to produce a tree file.

For both `-FS' and `-FM' `Context's, once a tree file is created it is
added to the set of tree files making up the `Context' and then it is
reused (without recreating it from sources again) for the queries
dealing with `Compilation_Unit's represented by this tree.

An advantage of these dynamic `Context' modes is that you do not have to
create the tree files explicitly; to users of an ASIS application based
on such `Context' modes the application appears to operate directly from
source files. But there is also a drawback, a consequence of the fact
that the content of a `Context' may change while the `Context' is open:
some ASIS queries dealing with `Compilation_Unit's or returning lists
of `Compilation_Unit's raise the `ASIS_Failed' exception (with
`Use_Error' status).

These queries are as follows:

    Asis.Compilation_Units:
         Library_Unit_Declarations
         Compilation_Unit_Bodies
         Compilation_Units
         Corresponding_Children

Another limitation of the dynamic `Context' mode is that ASIS uses the
standard GNAT naming scheme to compute the name of the source to be
compiled from the name of the corresponding Ada compilation unit. That
is, if the name of the source containing the code of some unit does not
follow the GNAT naming scheme, then ASIS will not locate this source,
and it will treat this unit as `Nil_Compilation_Unit'.

5 Debugging Information
***********************

There are two kinds of the debugging information available in
ASIS-for-GNAT -- debug images returned by the ASIS query `Debug_Image'
(for `Context's, `Compilation_Unit's and `Element's); and debug output
generated by ASIS queries when the corresponding implementation debug
flag is set ON during ASIS initialization (see *note Parameters of
Asis.Implementation.Initialize: 18.).

* Menu:

* Interpreting Debug Images::
* ASIS Debug Flags::


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: Interpreting Debug Images,  Next: ASIS Debug Flags,  Up: Debugging Information

5.1 Interpreting Debug Images
=============================

It is straightforward to interpret the debug images generated for the
main ASIS abstractions, because most of the information directly
corresponds to ASIS concepts. The following details of debug images are
implementation specific.

   * `Context'

        *
         `Context' Id
               This is the internal `Context' Id used in the
               implementation data structures. This Id is assigned to a
               `Context' when it is associated for the first time, and
               it remains unchanged and unique until ASIS is finalized.

        *
         All tree files
               The number of tree files making up the given `Context'.

   * `Compilation_Unit'

        *
         `Compilation_Unit' Id
               This is the internal `Compilation_Unit' Id used in the
               implementation data structures. This Id remains
               unchanged and unique until the unit's enclosed `Context'
               is closed.

        *
         Is consistent
               `True' if the same version of the unit's source was used
               for all the tree files making up the enclosed unit's
               context, and `False' otherwise

   * `Element'

        *
         Node, R_Node, Node_Field_1
               Tree nodes on which the internal representation of a
               given `Element' is based. They are meaningful only in
               the tree file indicated in the `Enclosing_Tree' field of
               the debug image

        *
         Special Case
               Implementation-specific indication of the cases when the
               `Element' needs some special processing.

        *
         Obtained from the tree
               The Id and the name of the tree file from which the
               tree-specific fields of the internal representation of
               given `Element' were obtained

        *
         `Rel_Sloc'
               Indicates the (relative) position of the source text of
               the `Element', counting from the beginning of the source
               of its enclosing compilation unit. Applies to implicit
               `Element's also.


File: asis_rm.info,  Node: ASIS Debug Flags,  Prev: Interpreting Debug Images,  Up: Debugging Information

5.2 ASIS Debug Flags
====================

ASIS provides several internal debug flags, which are described in
`a_debug.adb'. When one or more of these flags is set, useful internal
debugging information is directed to `Standard_Output'.  Although this
information is not always user-oriented, you may find the following
debug flags helpful when you are developing an ASIS application:

`-dc'
     Outputs the content of the internal data structures for a
     `Context', when the `Context' is closed and dissociated. By
     analyzing this information, you may map other debug information
     onto unit and tree Ids.

`-di'
     Turns off including the location of an `Element' into the result
     generated by `Debug_Image'. This may be useful if an ASIS program
     crashes because of some problem with ASIS structural queries
     (structural queries are used by `Element''s `Debug_Image' query to
     compute the source location of the argument).

`-do'
     When the `Context' is opened, lists the tree files being
     processed, and the ones selected to represent a given `Context'

`-dt'
     Outputs a message whenever a tree file is read in. This
     information may be useful for analyzing and reducing the tree
     swapping profile of your application.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

`Preamble'

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

`1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS'

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The `Document', below, refers
to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
and is addressed as "`you'".  You accept the license if you copy,
modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
copyright law.

A "`Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "`Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The "`Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "`Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may be
at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "`Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,
and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy
that is not "Transparent" is called `Opaque'.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "`Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "`publisher'" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "`Entitled XYZ'" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "`Acknowledgements'",
"`Dedications'", "`Endorsements'", or "`History'".)  To "`Preserve the
Title'" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it
remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.

`2. VERBATIM COPYING'

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

`3. COPYING IN QUANTITY'

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the
full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
You may add other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of
the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using public
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

`4. MODIFICATIONS'

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of
it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
     from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
     (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
     of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
     if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
     Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
     the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
     five), unless they release you from this requirement.

  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
     Version, as the publisher.

  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.

  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
     giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
     terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

  G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
     notice.

  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

  I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and
     add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
     and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create
     one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
     Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing
     the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
     public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
     the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
     it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
     You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
     least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
     publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

  K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
     Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.

  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
     their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent
     are not considered part of the section titles.

  M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may
     not be included in the Modified Version.

  N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
     or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

  O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you
may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

`5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS'

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any
sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections Entitled
"Endorsements".

`6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS'

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

`7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS'

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  When
the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply
to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

`8. TRANSLATION'

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
Invariant Sections.  You may include a translation of this License, and
all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
provided that you also include the original English version of this
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In
case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

`9. TERMINATION'

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

`10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE'

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be
used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

`11. RELICENSING'

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

`ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents'

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

     Copyright © YEAR  YOUR NAME.  Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant
     Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy
     of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
     Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with ... Texts." line with this:

     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
     LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
