2 Introduction
**************

The `gnatcheck' tool is an ASIS-based utility that checks properties of
Ada source files according to a given set of semantic rules.

In order to check compliance with a given rule, `gnatcheck' has to
semantically analyze the Ada sources.  Therefore, checks can only be
performed on legal Ada units. Moreover, when a unit depends
semantically upon units located outside the current directory, the
source search path has to be provided when calling `gnatcheck', either
through a specified project file or through `gnatcheck' switches as
described below.

If the set of sources to be processed by `gnatcheck' contains sources
with preprocessing directives then the needed options should be
provided to run preprocessor as a part of the `gnatcheck' call, and
detected rule violations will correspond to preprocessed sources.

A number of rules are predefined in `gnatcheck' and are described later
in this chapter.  You can also add new rules, by modifying the
`gnatcheck' code and rebuilding the tool. In order to add a simple rule
making some local checks, a small amount of straightforward ASIS-based
programming is usually needed.

Invoking `gnatcheck' on the command line has the form:

    $ gnatcheck [switches]  {filename}
          [-files={arg_list_filename}]
          [-cargs gcc_switches] -rules rule_options

where

   * `switches' specify the general tool options

   * Each `filename' is the name (including the extension) of a source
     file to process. 'Wildcards' are allowed, and the file name may
     contain path information.

   * Each `arg_list_filename' is the name (including the extension) of
     a text file containing the names of the source files to process,
     separated by spaces or line breaks.

   * `gcc_switches' is a list of switches for `gcc'. They will be
     passed on to all compiler invocations made by `gnatcheck' to
     generate the ASIS trees. Here you can provide `-I' switches to
     form the source search path, and use the `-gnatec' switch to set
     the configuration file, etc.

   * `rule_options' is a list of options for controlling a set of rules
     to be checked by `gnatcheck' (*note gnatcheck Rule Options: 7.).

Either a `filename' or an `arg_list_filename' must be supplied.

3 Format of the Report File
***************************

The `gnatcheck' tool outputs on `stderr' all messages concerning rule
violations except if running in quiet mode.  By default it also creates
a text file that contains the complete report of the last gnatcheck
run, this file is named `gnatcheck.out'. A user can specify generation
of the XML version of the report file (its default name is
`gnatcheck.xml') If `gnatcheck' is called with a project file, the
report file is located in the object directory defined by the project
file (or in the directory where the argument project file is located if
no object directory is defined), if `--subdirs' option is specified, the
file is placed in the subrirectory of this directory specified by this
option.  Otherwise it is located in the current directory; the `-o' or
`-ox' option can be used to change the name and/or location of the text
or XML report file.  This text report contains:

   * general details of the `gnatcheck' run: date and time of the run,
     the version of the tool that has generated this report, full
     parameters of the  `gnatcheck' invocation, reference to the list
     of checked sources and applied rules (coding standard);

   * summary of the run (number of checked sources and detected
     violations);

   * list of exempted coding standard violations;

   * list of non-exempted coding standard violations;

   * list of problems in the definition of exemption sections;

   * list of language violations (compile-time errors) detected in
     processed sources;

The references to the list of checked sources and applied rules are
references to the text files that contain the corresponding information.
These files could be either files supplied as `gnatcheck' parameters or
files created by `gnatcheck'; in the latter case these files are
located in the same directory as the report file.

The content of the XML report is similar to the text report except that
it explores the set of files processed by gnatcheck and the coding
standard used for checking these files.

4 General `gnatcheck' Switches
******************************

The following switches control the general `gnatcheck' behavior

 
`--version'
     Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other
     options.

`--help'
     Display usage, then exit disregarding all other options.

`-P file'
     Indicates the name of the project file that describes the set of
     sources to be processed. The exact set of argument sources depends
     on other options specified, see below.

`-U'
     If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
     specified (either directly or by means of `-files' option), process
     all the units of the closure of the argument project. Otherwise
     this option has no effect.

`-U main_unit'
     If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
     specified (either directly or by means of `-files' option), process
     the closure of units rooted at `main_unit'. Otherwise this option
     has no effect.

`-Xname=value'
     Indicates that external variable `name' in the argument project
     has the `value' value. Has no effect if no project is specified as
     tool argument.

`--subdirs=dir'
     Use the specified subdirectory of the project objects file (or of
     the project file directory if the project does not specify an
     object directory) for tool output files. Has no effect if no
     project is specified as tool argument or if `--no_objects_dir' is
     specified.

`--no_objects_dir'
     Place all the result files into the current directory instead of
     project objects directory.

`--RTS=rts-path'
     Specifies the default location of the runtime library. Same
     meaning as the equivalent `gnatmake' flag (see GNAT User's Guide).

`-a'
     Process all units including those with read-only ALI files such as
     those from the GNAT Run-Time library.

`--incremental'
     Incremental processing on a per-file basis. Source files are only
     processed if they have been modified, or if files they depend on
     have been modified. This is similar to the way gnatmake/gprbuild
     only compiles files that need to be recompiled. A project file is
     required in this mode, and the gnat driver (as in `gnat check') is
     not supported.  Note that rules requiring a global analysis
     (Recursive_Subprograms, Deeply_Nested_Inlining) are not supported
     in -incremental mode.

`-h'
     List all the rules checked by the given `gnatcheck' version.

`-j'nnnn
     Use `nnnn' processes to carry out the tree creations (internal
     representations of the argument sources). On a multiprocessor
     machine this speeds up processing of big sets of argument sources.
     If `n' is 0, then the maximum number of parallel tree creations is
     the number of core processors on the platform.

`-l'
     Use full source locations references in the report file. For a
     construct from a generic instantiation a full source location is a
     chain from the location of this construct in the generic unit to
     the place where this unit is instantiated.

`-log'
     Duplicate all the output sent to `stderr' into a log file. The log
     file is named `gnatcheck.log'. If a project file is specified as
     `gnatcheck' parameter then it is located in the project objects
     directory (or in the project file directory if no object directory
     is specified). Otherwise it is located in the current directory.

`-m'nnnn
     Maximum number of diagnostics to be sent to `stdout', where `nnnn'
     is in the range 0...1000; the default value is 500. Zero means
     that there is no limitation on the number of diagnostic messages
     to be output.

`-q'
     Quiet mode. All the diagnostics about rule violations are placed
     in the `gnatcheck' report file only, without duplication on
     `stdout'.

`-s'
     Short format of the report file (no version information, no list
     of applied rules, no list of checked sources is included)

`-xml'
     Generate the report file in XML format. Is not allowed in
     incremental mode.

`-nt'
     Do not generate the report file in text format. Enforces  `-xml',
     is not allowed in incremental mode.

`-files=filename'
          Take the argument source files from the specified file. This
          file should be an ordinary text file containing file names
          separated by spaces or line breaks. You can use this switch
          more than once in the same call to `gnatcheck'. You also can
          combine this switch with an explicit list of files.

`--show-rule'
     Add the corresponding rule name to the diagnosis generated for its
     violation.

`--include-file=file'
     Append the content of the specified text file to the report file

`-t'
     Print out execution time.

`-v'
     Verbose mode; `gnatcheck' generates version information and then a
     trace of sources being processed.

`-o report_file'
     Set name of the text report file to `report_file'.

`-ox report_file'
     Set name of the XML report file to `report_file'. Enforces  `-xml',
     is not allowed in incremental mode.

`--write-rules=template_file'
     Write to `template_file' the template rule file that contains all
     the rules currently implemented in `gnatcheck' turned off. A user
     may edit this template file manually to get his own coding
     standard file.

If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
specified (either directly or by means of `-files' option), and no `-U'
is specified, then the set of processed sources is all the immediate
units of the argument project.

5 `gnatcheck' Rule Options
**************************

The following options control the processing performed by `gnatcheck'.

 
`+Rrule_id[:param]'
     Turn on the check for a specified rule with the specified
     parameter, if any.  `rule_id' must be the identifier of one of the
     currently implemented rules (use `-h' for the list of implemented
     rules). Rule identifiers are not case-sensitive. The `param' item
     must be a string representing a valid parameter(s) for the
     specified rule.  If it contains any space characters then this
     string must be enclosed in quotation marks.

`-Rrule_id[:param]'
     Turn off the check for a specified rule with the specified
     parameter, if any.

`-from=rule_option_filename'
     Read the rule options from the text file `rule_option_filename',
     referred to as a 'coding standard file' below.

The default behavior is that all the rule checks are disabled.

If more than one rule option is specified for the same rule, these
options are summed together. If a new option contradicts the rule
settings specified by previous options for this rule, the new option
overrides the previous settings.

A coding standard file is a text file that contains a set of rule
options described above.

The file may contain empty lines and Ada-style comments (comment lines
and end-of-line comments). There can be several rule options on a
single line (separated by a space).

A coding standard file may reference other coding standard files by
including more `-from=rule_option_filename' options, each such option
being replaced with the content of the corresponding coding standard
file during processing. In case a cycle is detected (that is,
`rule_file_1' reads rule options from `rule_file_2', and `rule_file_2'
reads (directly or indirectly) rule options from `rule_file_1'),
processing fails with an error message.

If the name of the coding standard file does not contain a path
information in absolute form, then it is treated as being relative to
the current directory if gnatcheck is called without a project file or
as being relative to the project file directory if gnatcheck is called
with a project file as an argument.

6 Adding the Results of Compiler Checks to `gnatcheck' Output
*************************************************************

The `gnatcheck' tool can include in the generated diagnostic messages
and in the report file the results of the checks performed by the
compiler. Though disabled by default, this effect may be obtained by
using `+R' with the following rule identifiers and parameters:

`Restrictions'
     To record restrictions violations (which are performed by the
     compiler if the pragma `Restrictions' or `Restriction_Warnings'
     are given), use the `Restrictions' rule with the same parameters
     as pragma `Restrictions' or `Restriction_Warnings'.

     This rule allows parametric rule exemptions, the parameters that
     are allowed in the definition of exemption sections are the names
     of the restrictions except for the case when a restriction
     requires a non-numeric parameter, in this case the parameter
     should be the name of the restriction with the parameter, as it is
     given for the rule.

`Style_Checks'
     To record compiler style checks (see Style Checking section in
     GNAT User's Guide), use the `Style_Checks' rule.

     This rule takes a parameter in one of the following forms:

        *
         `All_Checks',
               which enables the standard style checks corresponding to
               the `-gnatyy' GNAT style check option, or

        * a string with the same structure and semantics as the
          `string_LITERAL' parameter of the GNAT pragma `Style_Checks'
          (see "Pragma Style_Checks" in the GNAT Reference Manual).

     For example, the `+RStyle_Checks:O' rule option activates the
     compiler style check that corresponds to `-gnatyO' style check
     option.

`Warnings'
     To record compiler warnings (see Warning Message Control section in
     GNAT User's Guide), use the `Warnings' rule with a parameter that
     is a valid `static_string_expression' argument of the GNAT pragma
     `Warnings' (see "Pragma Warnings" in the GNAT Reference Manual).
     Note that in case of gnatcheck 's' parameter, that corresponds to
     the GNAT `-gnatws' option, disables all the specific warnings, but
     not suppresses the warning mode, and 'e' parameter, corresponding
     to `-gnatwe' that means "treat warnings as errors", does not have
     any effect.

     This rule allows parametric rule exemptions, the parameters that
     are allowed in the definition of exemption sections are the same
     as the parameters of the rule itself. Note that parametric
     exemption sections have their effect only if either `.d' parameter
     is specified for the `Warnings' rule or if the `--show-rules'
     option is set.

To disable a specific restriction check, use `-RRestrictions' gnatcheck
option with the corresponding restriction name as a parameter. `-R' is
not available for `Style_Checks' and `Warnings' options, to disable
warnings and style checks, use the corresponding warning and style
options.

7 Rule exemption
****************

One of the most useful applications of `gnatcheck' is to automate the
enforcement of project-specific coding standards, for example in
safety-critical systems where particular features must be restricted in
order to simplify the certification effort.  However, it may sometimes
be appropriate to violate a coding standard rule, and in such cases the
rationale for the violation should be provided in the source program
itself so that the individuals reviewing or maintaining the program can
immediately understand the intent.

The `gnatcheck' tool supports this practice with the notion of a 'rule
exemption' covering a specific source code section. Normally rule
violation messages are issued both on `stderr' and in a report file. In
contrast, exempted violations are not listed on `stderr'; thus users
invoking `gnatcheck' interactively (e.g. in its GPS interface) do not
need to pay attention to known and justified violations. However,
exempted violations along with their justification are documented in a
special section of the report file that `gnatcheck' generates.

* gnatcheck Annotations Rules::


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Using pragma Annotate to Control Rule Exemption,  Next: gnatcheck Annotations Rules,  Up: Rule exemption

7.1 Using pragma `Annotate' to Control Rule Exemption
=====================================================

Rule exemption is controlled by pragma `Annotate' when its first
argument is 'gnatcheck'. The syntax of `gnatcheck''s exemption control
annotations is as follows:

    pragma Annotate (gnatcheck, exemption_control, Rule_Name [, justification]);

    exemption_control ::= Exempt_On | Exempt_Off

    Rule_Name         ::= string_literal

    justification     ::= string_literal

When a `gnatcheck' annotation has more than four arguments, `gnatcheck'
issues a warning and ignores the additional arguments.  If the
arguments do not follow the syntax above, `gnatcheck' emits a warning
and ignores the annotation.

The `Rule_Name' argument should be the name of some existing
`gnatcheck' rule.  Otherwise a warning message is generated and the
pragma is ignored. If `Rule_Name' denotes a rule that is not activated
by the given `gnatcheck' call, the pragma is ignored and no warning is
issued. The exception from this rule is that exemption sections for
`Warnings' rule are fully processed when `Restrictions' rule is
activated.

A source code section where an exemption is active for a given rule is
delimited by an `exempt_on' and `exempt_off' annotation pair:

    pragma Annotate (gnatcheck, Exempt_On, "Rule_Name", "justification");
    -- source code section
    pragma Annotate (gnatcheck, Exempt_Off, "Rule_Name");

For some rules it is possible specify rule parameter(s) when defining
an exemption section for a rule. This means that only the checks
corresponding to the given rule parameter(s) are exempted in this
section:

    pragma Annotate (gnatcheck, Exempt_On, "Rule_Name: Par1, Par2", "justification");
    -- source code section
    pragma Annotate (gnatcheck, Exempt_Off, "Rule_Name: Par1, Par2");

A parametric exemption section can be defined for a rule if a rule has
parameters and these parameters change the scope of the checks performed
by a rule. For example, if you define an exemption section for
'Restriction' rule with the parameter 'No_Allocators', then in this
section only the checks for `No_Allocators' will be exempted, and the
checks for all the other restrictions from your coding standard will be
performed as usial.

See the description of individual rules to check if parametric
exemptions are available for them and what is the format of the rule
parameters to be used in the corresponding parameters of the `Annotate'
pragmas.


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: gnatcheck Annotations Rules,  Prev: Using pragma Annotate to Control Rule Exemption,  Up: Rule exemption

7.2 `gnatcheck' Annotations Rules
=================================

   * An 'Exempt_Off' annotation can only appear after a corresponding
     'Exempt_On' annotation.

   * Exempted source code sections are only based on the source
     location of the annotations. Any source construct between the two
     annotations is part of the exempted source code section.

   * Exempted source code sections for different rules are independent.
     They can be nested or intersect with one another without
     limitation.  Creating nested or intersecting source code sections
     for the same rule is not allowed.

   * A matching 'Exempt_Off' annotation pragma for an 'Exempt_On' pragma
     that defines a parametric exemption section is the pragma that
     contains exactly the same set of rule parameters for the same rule.

   * Parametric exemption sections for the same rule with different
     parameters can intersect or overlap in case if the parameter sets
     for such sections have an empty intersection.

   * Malformed exempted source code sections are reported by a warning,
     and the corresponding rule exemptions are ignored.

   * When an exempted source code section does not contain at least one
     violation of the exempted rule, a warning is emitted on `stderr'.

   * If an 'Exempt_On' annotation pragma does not have a matching
     'Exempt_Off' annotation pragma in the same compilation unit, a
     warning is issued and the exemption section is considered to last
     until the end of the compilation unit source.

8 Predefined Rules
******************

The description of the rules currently implemented in `gnatcheck' is
given in this chapter.  The rule identifier is used as a parameter of
`gnatcheck''s `+R' or `-R' switches.

Be aware that most of these rules apply to specialized coding
requirements developed by individual users and may well not make sense
in other environments. In particular, there are many rules that conflict
with one another. Proper usage of gnatcheck involves selecting the rules
you wish to apply by looking at your independently developed coding
standards and finding the corresponding gnatcheck rules.

If not otherwise specified, a rule does not do any check for the
results of generic instantiations.

8.1.2.1 `Deep_Inheritance_Hierarchies'
......................................

Flags a tagged derived type declaration or an interface type
declaration if its depth (in its inheritance hierarchy) exceeds the
value specified by the `N' rule parameter. Types in generic
instantiations which violate this rule are also flagged; generic formal
types are not flagged. This rule also does not flag private extension
declarations. In the case of a private extension, the corresponding
full declaration is checked.

In most cases, the inheritance depth of a tagged type or interface type
is defined as 0 for a type with no parent and no progenitor, and
otherwise as 1 + max of the depths of the immediate parent and
immediate progenitors. If the declaration of a formal derived type has
no progenitor, or if the declaration of a formal interface type has
exactly one progenitor, then the inheritance depth of such a formal
derived/interface type is equal to the inheritance depth of its
parent/progenitor type, otherwise the general rule is applied.

If the rule flags a type declaration inside the generic unit, this
means that this type declaration will be flagged in any instantiation
of the generic unit. But if a type is derived from a format type or has
a formal progenitor and it is not flagged at the place where it is
defined in a generic unit, it may or may not be flagged in
instantiation, this depends of the inheritance depth of the actual
parameters.

This rule has the following (mandatory) parameter for the `+R' option:

`N'
     Integer not less than -1 specifying the maximal allowed depth of
     any inheritance hierarchy. If the rule parameter is set to -1, the
     rule flags all the declarations of tagged and interface types.

8.1.2.2 `Direct_Calls_To_Primitives'
....................................

Flag any nondispatching call to a dispatching primitive operation,
except for:

   * a call to the corresponding primitive of the parent type.  (This
     occurs in the common idiom where a primitive subprogram for a
     tagged type directly calls the same primitive subprogram of the
     parent type.)

   * a call to a primitive of an untagged private type, even though the
     full type may be tagged, when the call is made at a place where
     the view of the type is untagged.

This rule has the following (optional) parameters for the `+R' option:

`Except_Constructors'
     Do not flag nondispatching calls to functions if the function has a
     controlling result and no controlling parameters (in a traditional
     OO sense such functions may be considered as constructors).

8.1.2.3 `Too_Many_Parents'
..........................

Flag any tagged type declaration, interface type declaration, single
task declaration or single protected declaration that has more than `N'
`parents', where `N' is a parameter of the rule.  A `parent' here is
either a (sub)type denoted by the subtype mark from the
parent_subtype_indication (in case of a derived type declaration), or
any of the progenitors from the interface list (if any).

This rule has the following (mandatory) parameters for the `+R' option:

`N'
     Positive integer specifying the maximal allowed number of
     parents/progenitors.


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Visible_Components,  Prev: Too_Many_Parents,  Up: Object Orientation

8.1.2.4 `Visible_Components'
............................

Flag all the type declarations located in the visible part of a library
package or a library generic package that can declare a visible
component.  A visible component can be declared in a `record
definition' which appears on its own or as part of a record extension.
The `record definition' is flagged even if it contains no components.

`Record definitions' located in private parts of library (generic)
packages or in local (generic) packages are not flagged. `Record
definitions' in private packages, in package bodies, and in the main
subprogram body are not flagged.

This rule has no parameters.

The rules in this subsection may be used to enforce various feature
usages that support program portability.

File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Forbidden_Attributes,  Next: Forbidden_Pragmas,  Up: Portability

8.1.3.1 `Forbidden_Attributes'
..............................

Flag each use of the specified attributes. The attributes to be
detected are named in the rule's parameters.

This rule has the following parameters:

   * For the `+R' option

`Attribute_Designator'
     Adds the specified attribute to the set of attributes to be
     detected and sets the detection checks for all the specified
     attributes ON.  If `Attribute_Designator' does not denote any
     attribute defined in the Ada standard or in the GNAT Reference
     Manual, it is treated as the name of unknown attribute.

`GNAT'
     All the GNAT-specific attributes are detected; this sets the
     detection checks for all the specified attributes ON.

`ALL'
     All attributes are detected; this sets the rule ON.

   * For the `-R' option

`Attribute_Designator'
     Removes the specified attribute from the set of attributes to be
     detected without affecting detection checks for other attributes.
     If `Attribute_Designator' does not correspond to any attribute
     defined in the Ada standard or in the GNAT Reference Manual, this
     option is treated as turning OFF detection of all unknown
     attributes.

GNAT
     Turn OFF detection of all GNAT-specific attributes

ALL
     Clear the list of the attributes to be detected and turn the rule
     OFF.

Parameters are not case sensitive. If `Attribute_Designator' does not
have the syntax of an Ada identifier and therefore can not be
considered as a (part of an) attribute designator, a diagnostic message
is generated and the corresponding parameter is ignored. (If an
attribute allows a static expression to be a part of the attribute
designator, this expression is ignored by this rule.)

When more than one parameter is given in the same rule option, the
parameters must be separated by commas.

If more than one option for this rule is specified for the gnatcheck
call, a new option overrides the previous one(s).

The `+R' option with no parameters turns the rule ON, with the set of
attributes to be detected defined by the previous rule options.  (By
default this set is empty, so if the only option specified for the rule
is `+RForbidden_Attributes' (with no parameter), then the rule is
enabled, but it does not detect anything).  The `-R' option with no
parameter turns the rule OFF, but it does not affect the set of
attributes to be detected.

The rule allows parametric exemption, the parameters that are allowed
in the definition of exemption sections are `Attribute_Designators'.
Each `Attribute_Designator' used as a rule exemption parameter should
denote a predefined or GNAT-specific attribute.


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Forbidden_Pragmas,  Next: Implicit_SMALL_For_Fixed_Point_Types,  Prev: Forbidden_Attributes,  Up: Portability

8.1.3.2 `Forbidden_Pragmas'
...........................

Flag each use of the specified pragmas.  The pragmas to be detected are
named in the rule's  parameters.

This rule has the following parameters:

   * For the `+R' option

`Pragma_Name'
     Adds the specified pragma to the set of pragmas to be checked and
     sets the checks for all the specified pragmas ON. `Pragma_Name' is
     treated as a name of a pragma. If it does not correspond to any
     pragma name defined in the Ada standard or to the name of a
     GNAT-specific pragma defined in the GNAT Reference Manual, it is
     treated as the name of unknown pragma.

`GNAT'
     All the GNAT-specific pragmas are detected; this sets the checks
     for all the specified pragmas ON.

`ALL'
     All pragmas are detected; this sets the rule ON.

   * For the `-R' option

`Pragma_Name'
     Removes the specified pragma from the set of pragmas to be checked
     without affecting checks for other pragmas. `Pragma_Name' is
     treated as a name of a pragma. If it does not correspond to any
     pragma defined in the Ada standard or to any name defined in the
     GNAT Reference Manual, this option is treated as turning OFF
     detection of all unknown pragmas.

GNAT
     Turn OFF detection of all GNAT-specific pragmas

ALL
     Clear the list of the pragmas to be detected and turn the rule OFF.

Parameters are not case sensitive. If `Pragma_Name' does not have the
syntax of an Ada identifier and therefore can not be considered as a
pragma name, a diagnostic message is generated and the corresponding
parameter is ignored.

When more than one parameter is given in the same rule option, the
parameters must be separated by a comma.

If more than one option for this rule is specified for the `gnatcheck'
call, a new option overrides the previous one(s).

The `+R' option with no parameters turns the rule ON with the set of
pragmas to be detected defined by the previous rule options.  (By
default this set is empty, so if the only option specified for the rule
is `+RForbidden_Pragmas' (with no parameter), then the rule is enabled,
but it does not detect anything).  The `-R' option with no parameter
turns the rule OFF, but it does not affect the set of pragmas to be
detected.

Note that in case when the rule is enabled with `ALL' parameter, then
the rule will flag also pragmas `Annotate' used to exempt rules, see
*note Rule exemption: 9. Even if you exempt this `Forbidden_Pragmas'
rule then the pragma `Annotate' that closes the exemption section will
be flagged as non-exempted. To avoid this, turn off the check for pragma
`Annotate' by using `-RForbidden_Pragmas:Annotate' rule option.

The rule allows parametric exemption, the parameters that are allowed
in the definition of exemption sections are pragma names. Each name
used as a rule exemption parameter should denote a predefined or
GNAT-specific pragma.

8.1.3.3 `Implicit_SMALL_For_Fixed_Point_Types'
..............................................

Flag each fixed point type declaration that lacks an explicit
representation  clause to define its `'Small' value.  Since `'Small'
can be  defined only for ordinary fixed point types, decimal fixed
point type declarations are not checked.

This rule has no parameters.

8.1.3.4 `No_Scalar_Storage_Order_Specified'
...........................................

Flag each record type declaration, record extension declaration, and
untagged derived record type declaration if a
record_representation_clause that has at least one component clause
applies to it (or an ancestor), but neither the type nor any of its
ancestors has an explicitly specified Scalar_Storage_Order attribute.

This rule has no parameters.

8.1.3.5 `Predefined_Numeric_Types'
..................................

Flag each explicit use of the name of any numeric type or subtype
declared in package `Standard'.

The rationale for this rule is to detect when the program may depend on
platform-specific characteristics of the implementation of the
predefined numeric types. Note that this rule is overly pessimistic;
for example, a program that uses `String' indexing likely needs a
variable of type `Integer'.  Another example is the flagging of
predefined numeric types with explicit constraints:

    subtype My_Integer is Integer range Left .. Right;
    Vy_Var : My_Integer;

This rule detects only numeric types and subtypes declared in package
`Standard'. The use of numeric types and subtypes declared in other
predefined packages (such as `System.Any_Priority' or
`Ada.Text_IO.Count') is not flagged

This rule has no parameters.


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Separate_Numeric_Error_Handlers,  Prev: Predefined_Numeric_Types,  Up: Portability

8.1.3.6 `Separate_Numeric_Error_Handlers'
.........................................

Flags each exception handler that contains a choice for the predefined
`Constraint_Error' exception, but does not contain the choice for the
predefined `Numeric_Error' exception, or that contains the choice for
`Numeric_Error', but does not contain the choice for `Constraint_Error'.

This rule has no parameters.

File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Deeply_Nested_Generics,  Next: Local_Packages,  Up: Program Structure

8.1.4.1 `Deeply_Nested_Generics'
................................

Flag a generic declaration nested in another generic declaration if the
nesting level of the inner generic exceeds the value specified by the
`N' rule parameter.  The nesting level is the number of generic
declarations that enclose the given (generic) declaration. Formal
packages are not flagged by this rule.

This rule has the following (mandatory) parameters for the `+R' option:

`N'
     Positive integer specifying the maximum nesting level for a
     generic declaration.

8.1.4.3 `Non_Visible_Exceptions'
................................

Flag constructs leading to the possibility of propagating an exception
out of the scope in which the exception is declared.  Two cases are
detected:

   * An exception declaration in a subprogram body, task body or block
     statement is flagged if the body or statement does not contain a
     handler for that exception or a handler with an `others' choice.

   * A `raise' statement in an exception handler of a subprogram body,
     task body or block statement is flagged if it (re)raises a locally
     declared exception.  This may occur under the following
     circumstances:

        * it explicitly raises a locally declared exception, or

        * it does not specify an exception name (i.e., it is simply
          `raise;') and the enclosing handler contains a locally
          declared exception in its exception choices.

Renamings of local exceptions are not flagged.

This rule has no parameters.


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Raising_External_Exceptions,  Prev: Non_Visible_Exceptions,  Up: Program Structure

8.1.4.4 `Raising_External_Exceptions'
.....................................

Flag any `raise' statement, in a program unit declared in a library
package or in a generic library package, for an exception that is
neither a predefined exception nor an exception that is also declared
(or renamed) in the visible part of the package.

This rule has no parameters.

predefined Ada type. Do not flag record extensions and private
extensions. The rule is checked inside expanded generics.

This rule has no parameters.

8.1.5.5 `Enumeration_Ranges_In_CASE_Statements'
...............................................

Flag each use of a range of enumeration literals as a choice in a
`case' statement.  All forms for specifying a range (explicit ranges
such as `A .. B', subtype marks and `'Range' attributes) are flagged.
An enumeration range is flagged even if contains exactly one
enumeration value or no values at all. A type derived from an
enumeration type is considered as an enumeration type.

This rule helps prevent maintenance problems arising from adding an
enumeration value to a type and having it implicitly handled by an
existing `case' statement with an enumeration range that includes the
new literal.

This rule has no parameters.

Flag any exit statement if it transfers the control out of a `for' loop
or a `while' loop. This includes cases when the `exit' statement
applies to a `FOR' or `while' loop, and cases when it is enclosed in
some `for' or `while' loop, but transfers the control from some outer
(unconditional) `loop' statement.

The rule has no parameters.

8.1.5.10 `Global_Variables'
...........................

Flag any variable declaration that appears immediately within the
specification of a library package or library generic package. Variable
declarations in nested packages and inside package instantiations are
not flagged.

This rule has the following (optional) parameters for the `+R' option:

`Only_Public'
     Do not flag variable declarations in private library (generic)
     packages and in package privat parts.

8.1.5.12 `Improper_Returns'
...........................

Flag each explicit `return' statement in procedures, and multiple
`return' statements in functions.  Diagnostic messages are generated
for all `return' statements in a procedure (thus each procedure must be
written so that it returns implicitly at the end of its statement part),
and for all `return' statements in a function after the first one.
This rule supports the stylistic convention that each subprogram should
have no more than one point of normal return.

Flag any subprogram declaration, subprogram body declaration, expression
function declaration, null procedure declaration, subprogram body stub
or generic subprogram declaration if the corresponding subprogram has
more than `N' formal parameters, where `N' is a parameter of the rule.

A subprogram body, an expression function, a null procedure or a
subprogram body stub is flagged only if there is no separate
declaration for this subprogram. Subprogram renaming declarations and
subprogram instantiations, as well as declarations inside expanded
generic instantiations are never flagged.

This rule has the following (mandatory) parameters for the `+R' option:

`N'
     Positive integer specifying the maximum allowed total number of
     subprogram formal parameters.

Flag any subprogram declaration, subprogram body declaration, subprogram
instantiation, expression function declaration or subprogram body stub
that is not a completion of another subprogram declaration and that is
declared within subprogram body (including bodies of generic
subprograms), task body or entry body directly or indirectly (that is -
inside a local nested package). Protected subprograms are not flagged.

anonymous access or array type definition. Record component definitions
and parameter specifications are not flagged. Formal object declarations
defined with anonymous access definitions are flagged.

This rule has no parameters.

...............................

Flag each use of an `others' choice in extension aggregates.  In record
and array aggregates, an `others' choice is flagged unless it is used
to refer to all components, or to all but one component.

If, in case of a named array aggregate, there are two associations, one
with an `others' choice and another with a discrete range, the `others'
choice is flagged even if the discrete range specifies exactly one
component; for example, `(1..1 => 0, others => 1)'.

   * `if' statement

   * `case' statement

   * `loop' statement

   * selective accept statement

   * timed entry call statement

   * conditional entry call statement

   * asynchronous select statement

The rule has the following parameter for the `+R' option:

`N'
     Positive integer specifying the maximal control structure nesting
     level that is not flagged

If the parameter for the `+R' option is not specified or if it is not a
positive integer, `+R' option is ignored.

The rules described in this subsection may be used to enforce feature
usages that contribute towards readability.

* Misnamed_Controlling_Parameters::
* Name_Clashes::

File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Identifier_Casing,  Next: Identifier_Prefixes,  Up: Readability

8.1.6.1 `Identifier_Casing'
...........................

Flag each defining identifier that does not have a casing corresponding
to the kind of entity being declared. All defining names are checked.
For the defining names from the following kinds of declarations a
special casing scheme can be defined:

   * type and subtype declarations;

   * enumeration literal specifications (not including character
     literals) and function renaming declarations if the renaming
     entity is an enumeration literal;

   * constant and number declarations (including object renaming
     declarations if the renamed object is a constant);

   * exception declarations and exception renaming declarations.

The rule may have the following parameters for `+R':

   * Type=`casing_scheme'

     Specifies casing for names from type and subtype declarations.

   * Enum=`casing_scheme'

     Specifies the casing of defining enumeration literals and for the
     defining names in a function renaming declarations if the renamed
     entity is an enumeration literal.

   * Constant=`casing_scheme'

     Specifies the casing for defining names from constants and named
     number declarations, including the object renaming declaration if
     the renamed object is a constant

   * Exception=`casing_scheme'

     Specifies the casing for names from exception declarations and
     exception renaming declarations.

   * Others=`casing_scheme'

     Specifies the casing for all defining names for which no special
     casing scheme is specified. If this parameter is not set, the
     casing for the entities that do not correspond to the specified
     parameters is not checked.

   * Exclude=`dictionary_file'

     Specifies casing exceptions.

Where:

    casing_scheme ::= upper|lower|mixed

`upper' means that the defining identifier should be upper-case.
`lower' means that the defining identifier should be lower-case `mixed'
means that the first defining identifier letter and the first letter
after each underscore should be upper-case, and all the other letters
should be lower-case

If a defining identifier is from a declaration for which a specific
casing scheme can be set, but the corresponding parameter is not
specified for the rule, then the casing scheme defined by `Others'
parameter is used to check this identifier. If `Others' parameter also
is not set, the identifier is not checked.

`dictionary_file' is the name of the text file that contains casing
exceptions. The way how this rule is using the casing exception
dictionary file is consistent with using the casing exception
dictionary in the GNAT pretty-printer `gnatpp', see GNAT User's Guide.

There are two kinds of exceptions:

`identifier'
     If a dictionary file contains an identifier, then each occurrence
     of that (defining) identifier in the checked source should use the
     casing specified included in `dictionary_file'

`wildcard'
     A wildcard has the following syntax

    wildcard ::= *simple_identifier* |
                       *simple_identifier |
                       simple_identifier*
    simple_identifier ::= letter{letter_or_digit}

`simple_identifier' specifies the casing of subwords (the term 'subword'
is used below to denote the part of a name which is delimited by '_' or
by the beginning or end of the word and which does not contain any '_'
inside).  A wildcard of the form `simple_identifier*' defines the
casing of the first subword of a defining name to check, the wildcard
of the form `*simple_identifier' specifies the casing of the last
subword, and the wildcard of the form `*simple_identifier*' specifies
the casing of any subword.

If for a defining identifier some of its subwords can be mapped onto
wildcards, but some other cannot, the casing of the identifier subwords
that are not mapped onto wildcards from casing exception dictionary is
checked against the casing scheme defined for the corresponding entity.

If some identifier is included in the exception dictionary both as a
whole identifier and can be mapped onto some wildcard from the
dictionary, then it is the identifier and not the wildcard that is used
to check the identifier casing.

If more than one dictionary file is specified, or a dictionary file
contains more than one exception variant for the same identifier, the
new casing exception overrides the previous one.

Casing check against dictionary file(s) has a higher priority than
checks against the casing scheme specified for a given
entity/declaration kind.

`+R' option should contain at least one parameter.

There is no parameter for `-R' option, it just turns the rule off.

The rule allows parametric exemption, the parameters that are allowed in
the definition of exemption sections are:

`Type'
     Exempts check for type and subtype name casing

`Enum'
     Exempts check for enumeration literal name casing

`Constant'
     Exempts check for constant name casing

`Exception'
     Exempts check for exception name casing

`Others'
     Exempts check for defining names for which no special casing
     scheme is specified.

`Exclude'
     Exempts check for defining names for which casing schemes are
     specified in exception dictionaries

8.1.6.2 `Identifier_Prefixes'
.............................

Flag each defining identifier that does not have a prefix corresponding
to the kind of declaration it is defined by. The defining names in the
following kinds of declarations are checked:

   * type and subtype declarations (task, protected and access types
     are treated separately);

   * enumeration literal specifications (not including character
     literals) and function renaming declarations if the renaming
     entity is an enumeration literal;

   * exception declarations and exception renaming declarations;

   * constant and number declarations (including object renaming
     declarations if the renamed object is a constant).

Defining names declared by single task declarations or single protected
declarations are not checked by this rule.

The defining name from the full type declaration corresponding to a
private type declaration or a private extension declaration is never
flagged. A defining name from an incomplete type declaration is never
flagged.

The defining name from a subprogram renaming-as-body declaration is
never flagged.

For a deferred constant, the defining name in the corresponding full
constant declaration is never flagged.

The defining name from a body that is a completion of a program unit
declaration or a proper body of a subunit is never flagged.

The defining name from a body stub that is a completion of a program
unit declaration is never flagged.

Note that the rule checks only defining names. Usage name occurrence are
not checked and are never flagged.

The rule may have the following parameters:

   * For the `+R' option:

   * Type=`string'

          Specifies the prefix for a type or subtype name.

   * Concurrent=`string'

          Specifies the prefix for a task and protected type/subtype
          name. If this parameter is set, it overrides for task and
          protected types the prefix set by the Type parameter.

   * Access=`string'

          Specifies the prefix for an access type/subtype name. If this
          parameter is set, it overrides for access types the prefix
          set by the `Type' parameter.

   * Class_Access=`string'

          Specifies the prefix for the name of an access type/subtype
          that points to some class-wide type. If this parameter is
          set, it overrides for such access types and subtypes the
          prefix set by the `Type' or `Access' parameter.

   * Subprogram_Access=`string'

          Specifies the prefix for the name of an access type/subtype
          that points to a subprogram. If this parameter is set, it
          overrides for such access types/subtypes the prefix set by
          the `Type' or `Access' parameter.

   * Derived=`string1:string2'

          Specifies the prefix for a type that is directly derived from
          a given type or from a subtype thereof. `string1' should be a
          full expanded Ada name of the ancestor type (starting from
          the full expanded compilation unit name), `string2' defines
          the prefix to check. If this parameter is set, it overrides
          for types that are directly derived from the given type the
          prefix set by the `Type' parameter.

   * Constant=`string'

          Specifies the prefix for defining names from constants and
          named number declarations, including the object renaming
          declaration if the renamed object is a constant

   * Enum=`string'

          Specifies the prefix for defining enumeration literals and
          for the defining names in a function renaming declarations if
          the renamed entity is an enumeration literal.

   * Exception=`string'

          Specifies the prefix for defining names from exception
          declarations and exception renaming declarations.

`Exclusive'
          Check that only those kinds of names for which specific
          prefix is defined have that prefix (e.g., only type/subtype
          names have prefix `T_', but not variable or package names),
          and flag all defining names that have any of the specified
          prefixes but do not belong to the kind of entities this
          prefix is defined for. By default the exclusive check mode is
          ON.

     For the `-R' option:

`All_Prefixes'
     Removes all the prefixes specified for the identifier prefix
     checks, whether by default or as specified by other rule
     parameters and disables the rule.

`Type'
     Removes the prefix specified for type/subtype names. This does not
     remove prefixes specified for specific type kinds and does not
     disable checks for these specific kinds.

`Concurrent'
     Removes the prefix specified for task and protected types.

`Access'
     Removes the prefix specified for access types. This does not
     remove prefixes specified for specific access types (access to
     subprograms and class-wide access)

`Class_Access'
     Removes the prefix specified for access types pointing to
     class-wide types.

`Subprogram_Access'
     Removes the prefix specified for access types pointing to
     subprograms.

`Derived'
     Removes prefixes specified for derived types that are directly
     derived from specific types.

`Constant'
     Removes the prefix specified for constant and number names and
     turns off the check for these names.

`Exception'
     Removes the prefix specified for exception names and turns off the
     check for exception names.

`Enum'
     Removes the prefix specified for enumeration literal names and
     turns off the check for them.

`Exclusive'
     Turns of the check that only names of specific kinds of entities
     have prefixes specified for these kinds.

If more than one parameter is used, parameters must be separated by
commas.

If more than one option is specified for the gnatcheck invocation, a new
option overrides the previous one(s).

The `+RIdentifier_Prefixes' option (with no parameter) enables checks
for all the name prefixes specified by previous options used for this
rule. If no prefix is specified, the rule is not enabled.

The `-RIdentifier_Prefixes' option (with no parameter) disables all the
checks but keeps all the prefixes specified by previous options used for
this rule.

There is no default prefix setting for this rule. All checks for name
prefixes are case-sensitive

If any error is detected in a rule parameter, that parameter is ignored.
In such a case the options that are set for the rule are not specified.

The rule allows parametric exemption, the parameters that are allowed in
the definition of exemption sections are:

`Type'
     Exempts check for type and subtype name prefixes

`Concurrent'
     Exempts check for task and protected type/subtype name prefixes

`Access'
     Exempts check for access type/subtype name prefixes

`Class_Access'
     Exempts check for names of access types/subtypes that point to
     some class-wide types

`Subprogram_Access'
     Exempts check for names of access types/subtypes that point to
     subprograms

`Derived'
     Exempts check for derived type name prefixes

`Constant'
     Exempts check for constant and number name prefixes

`Exception'
     Exempts check for exception name prefixes

`Enum'
     Exempts check for enumeration literal name prefixes

`Exclusive'
     Exempts check that only names of specific kinds of entities have
     prefixes specified for these kinds


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Identifier_Suffixes,  Next: Misnamed_Controlling_Parameters,  Prev: Identifier_Prefixes,  Up: Readability

8.1.6.3 `Identifier_Suffixes'
.............................

Flag the declaration of each identifier that does not have a suffix
corresponding to the kind of entity being declared.  The following
declarations are checked:

   * type declarations

   * subtype declarations

   * object declarations (variable and constant declarations, but not
     number, declarations, record component declarations, parameter
     specifications, extended return object declarations, formal object
     declarations)

   * package renaming declarations (but not generic package renaming
     declarations)

The default checks (enforced by the `Default' rule parameter) are:

   * type-defining names end with `_T', unless the type is an access
     type, in which case the suffix must be `_A'

   * constant names end with `_C'

   * names defining package renamings end with `_R'

   * the check for access type objects is not enabled

Defining identifiers from incomplete type declarations are never
flagged.

For a private type declaration (including private extensions), the
defining identifier from the private type declaration is checked
against the type suffix (even if the corresponding full declaration is
an access type declaration), and the defining identifier from the
corresponding full type declaration is not checked.

For a deferred constant, the defining name in the corresponding full
constant declaration is not checked.

Defining names of formal types are not checked.

Check for the suffix of access type data objects is applied to the
following kinds of declarations:

   * variable and constant declaration

   * record component declaration

   * return object declaration

   * parameter specification

   * extended return object declaration

   * formal object declaration

If both checks for constant suffixes and for access object suffixes are
enabled, and if different suffixes are defined for them, then for
constants of access type the check for access object suffixes suffixes
is applied.

The rule may have the following parameters:

   * For the `+R' option (unless the parameter is `Default', then only
     the explicitly specified suffix is checked, and no defaults are
     used):

`Default'
     Sets the default listed above for all the names to be checked.

   * Type_Suffix=`string'

          Specifies the suffix for a type name.

   * Access_Suffix=`string'

          Specifies the suffix for an access type name. If this
          parameter is set, it overrides for access types the suffix
          set by the `Type_Suffix' parameter.  For access types,
          `string' may have the following format: `suffix1(suffix2)'.
          That means that an access type name should have the `suffix1'
          suffix except for the case when the designated type is also
          an access type, in this case the type name should have the
          `suffix1 & suffix2' suffix.

   * Class_Access_Suffix=`string'

          Specifies the suffix for the name of an access type that
          points to some class-wide type.  If this parameter is set, it
          overrides for such access types the suffix set by the
          `Type_Suffix' or `Access_Suffix' parameter.

   * Class_Subtype_Suffix=`string'

          Specifies the suffix for the name of a subtype that denotes a
          class-wide type.

   * Constant_Suffix=`string'

          Specifies the suffix for a constant name.

   * Renaming_Suffix=`string'

          Specifies the suffix for a package renaming name.

   * Access_Obj_Suffix=`string'

          Specifies the suffix for objects that have an access type
          (including types derived from access types).

   * For the `-R' option:

`All_Suffixes'
     Remove all the suffixes specified for the identifier suffix
     checks, whether by default or as specified by other rule
     parameters. All the checks for this rule are disabled as a result.

`Type_Suffix'
     Removes the suffix specified for types. This disables checks for
     types but does not disable any other checks for this rule
     (including the check for access type names if `Access_Suffix' is
     set).

`Access_Suffix'
     Removes the suffix specified for access types.  This disables
     checks for access type names but does not disable any other checks
     for this rule.  If `Type_Suffix' is set, access type names are
     checked as ordinary type names.

`Class_Access_Suffix'
     Removes the suffix specified for access types pointing to
     class-wide type. This disables specific checks for names of access
     types pointing to class-wide types but does not disable any other
     checks for this rule.  If `Type_Suffix' is set, access type names
     are checked as ordinary type names. If `Access_Suffix' is set,
     these access types are checked as any other access type name.

`Class_Subtype_Suffix'
     Removes the suffix specified for subtype names.  This disables
     checks for subtype names but does not disable any other checks for
     this rule.

`Constant_Suffix'
     Removes the suffix specified for constants. This disables checks
     for constant names but does not disable any other checks for this
     rule.

`Renaming_Suffix'
     Removes the suffix specified for package renamings. This disables
     checks for package renamings but does not disable any other checks
     for this rule.

`Access_Obj_Suffix'
     Removes the suffix specified for objects of access types, this
     disables checks for such objects. It does not disable any other
     checks for this rule

If more than one parameter is used, parameters must be separated by
commas.

If more than one  option is specified for the `gnatcheck' invocation, a
new option overrides the previous one(s).

The `+RIdentifier_Suffixes' option (with no parameter) enables checks
for all the name suffixes specified by previous options used for this
rule.

The `-RIdentifier_Suffixes' option (with no parameter) disables all the
checks but keeps all the suffixes specified by previous options used
for this rule.

The `string' value must be a valid suffix for an Ada identifier (after
trimming all the leading and trailing space characters, if any).
Parameters are not case sensitive, except the `string' part.

If any error is detected in a rule parameter, the parameter is ignored.
In such a case the options that are set for the rule are not specified.

The rule allows parametric exemption, the parameters that are allowed in
the definition of exemption sections are:

`Type'
     Exempts check for type name suffixes

`Access'
     Exempts check for access type name suffixes

`Access_Obj'
     Exempts check for access object name suffixes

`Class_Access'
     Exempts check for names of access types that point to some
     class-wide types

`Class_Subtype'
     Exempts check for names of subtypes that denote class-wide types

`Constant'

.........................................

Flag a declaration of a dispatching operation, if the first parameter is
not a controlling one and its name is not `This' (the check for
parameter name is not case-sensitive). Declarations of dispatching
functions with a controlling result and no controlling parameter are
never flagged.

A subprogram body declaration, subprogram renaming declaration, or
subprogram body stub is flagged only if it is not a completion of a
prior subprogram declaration.

8.1.6.5 `Name_Clashes'
......................

Check that certain names are not used as defining identifiers. The
names that should not be used as identifiers must be listed in a
dictionary file that is a rule parameter. A defining identifier is
flagged if it is included in a dictionary file specified as a rule
parameter, the check is not case-sensitive.  More than one dictionary
file can be specified as the rule parameter, in this case the rule
checks defining identifiers against the union of all the identifiers
from all the dictionary files provided as the rule parameters.

This rule has the following (mandatory) parameters for the `+R' option:

`dictionary_file'
     The name of a dictionary file.

This rule is enabled by default, but without setting any corresponding
dictionary file(s); thus the default effect is to do no checks.

A dictionary file is a plain text file. The maximum line length for
this file is 1024 characters.  If the line is longer than this limit,
extra characters are ignored.

Each line can be either an empty line, a comment line, or a line
containing a list of identifiers separated by space or HT characters.
A comment is an Ada-style comment (from `--' to end-of-line).
Identifiers must follow the Ada syntax for identifiers.  A line
containing one or more identifiers may end with a comment.

8.1.6.6 `Uncommented_BEGIN_In_Package_Bodies'
.............................................

Flags each package body with declarations and a statement part that
does not include a trailing comment on the line containing the `begin'
keyword; this trailing comment needs to specify the package name and
nothing else.  The `begin' is not flagged if the package body does not
contain any declarations.

If the `begin' keyword is placed on the same line as the last
declaration or the first statement, it is flagged independently of
whether the line contains a trailing comment. The diagnostic message is
attached to the line containing the first statement.

This rule has no parameters.

8.2.1 `Abstract_Type_Declarations'
----------------------------------

Flag all declarations of abstract types. For an abstract private type,
both the private and full type declarations are flagged.

This rule has no parameters.


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Anonymous_Subtypes,  Next: Blocks,  Prev: Abstract_Type_Declarations,  Up: Feature Usage Rules

8.2.2 `Anonymous_Subtypes'
--------------------------

Flag all uses of anonymous subtypes (except cases when subtype
indication is a part of a record component definition, and this subtype
indication depends on a discriminant). A use of an anonymous subtype is
any instance of a subtype indication with a constraint, other than one
that occurs immediately within a subtype declaration. Any use of a range
other than as a constraint used immediately within a subtype declaration
is considered as an anonymous subtype.

The rule does not flag ranges in the component clauses from a record
representation clause, because the language rules do not allow to use
subtype names there.

An effect of this rule is that `for' loops such as the following are
flagged (since `1..N' is formally a 'range'):

    for I in 1 .. N loop
       ...
    end loop;

Declaring an explicit subtype solves the problem:

    subtype S is Integer range 1..N;
    ...
    for I in S loop
       ...
    end loop;

This rule has no parameters.

8.2.4 `Complex_Inlined_Subprograms'
-----------------------------------

Flag a subprogram (or generic subprogram, or instantiation of a
subprogram) if pragma Inline is applied to it and at least one of the
following conditions is met:

   * it contains at least one complex declaration such as a subprogram
     body, package, task, protected declaration, or a generic
     instantiation (except instantiation of `Ada.Unchecked_Conversion');

   * it contains at least one complex statement such as a loop, a case
     or an if statement;

   * the number of statements exceeds a value specified by the `N' rule
     parameter;

Subprogram renamings are also considered.

This rule has the following (mandatory) parameter for the `+R' option:

`N'
     Positive integer specifying the maximum allowed total number of
     statements in the subprogram body.

8.2.6 `Controlled_Type_Declarations'
------------------------------------

Flag all declarations of controlled types. A declaration of a private
type is flagged if its full declaration declares a controlled type. A
declaration of a derived type is flagged if its ancestor type is
controlled. Subtype declarations are not checked. A declaration of a
type that itself is not a descendant of a type declared in

8.2.8 `Deeply_Nested_Inlining'
------------------------------

Flag a subprogram (or generic subprogram) if pragma Inline has been
applied to it, and it calls another subprogram to which pragma Inline
applies, resulting in potential nested inlining, with a nesting depth
exceeding the value specified by the `N' rule parameter.

This rule requires the global analysis of all the compilation units that
are `gnatcheck' arguments; such analysis may affect the tool's
performance.

This rule has the following (mandatory) parameter for the `+R' option:

`N'
     Positive integer specifying the maximum level of nested calls to
     subprograms to which pragma Inline has been applied.

8.2.12 `Fixed_Equality_Checks'
------------------------------

Flag all calls to the predefined equality operations for fixed-point
types.  Both '`='' and '`/='' operations are checked.  User-defined
equality operations are not flagged, nor are uses of operators that are
renamings of the predefined equality operations.  Also, the '`='' and
'`/='' operations for floating-point types are not flagged.

8.2.14 `Function_Style_Procedures'
----------------------------------

Flag each procedure that can be rewritten as a function. A procedure
can be converted into a function if it has exactly one parameter of
mode `out' and no parameters of mode `in out'. Procedure declarations,
formal procedure declarations, and generic procedure declarations are
always checked. Procedure bodies and body stubs are flagged only if
they do not have corresponding separate declarations. Procedure
renamings and procedure instantiations are not flagged.

If a procedure can be rewritten as a function, but its `out' parameter
is of a limited type, it is not flagged.

Protected procedures are not flagged. Null procedures also are not
flagged.

This rule has no parameters.

--------------------------------

Flag each declaration of a generic unit in a subprogram. Generic
declarations in the bodies of generic subprograms are also flagged.  A
generic unit nested in another generic unit is not flagged.  If a
generic unit is declared in a local package that is declared in a
subprogram body, the generic unit is flagged.

This rule has no parameters.

8.2.20 `Non_Qualified_Aggregates'
---------------------------------

Flag each non-qualified aggregate.  A non-qualified aggregate is an
aggregate that is not the expression of a qualified expression. A
string literal is not considered an aggregate, but an array aggregate
of a string type is considered as a normal aggregate.  Aggregates of
anonymous array types are not flagged.

This rule has no parameters.


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Numeric_Literals,  Next: Parameters_Out_Of_Order,  Prev: Non_Qualified_Aggregates,  Up: Feature Usage Rules

8.2.21 `Numeric_Literals'
-------------------------

Flag each use of a numeric literal in an index expression, and in any
circumstance except for the following:

   * a literal occurring in the initialization expression for a constant
     declaration or a named number declaration, or

   * a literal occurring in an aspect definition or in an aspect
     clause, or

   * an integer literal that is less than or equal to a value specified
     by the `N' rule parameter.

   * a literal occurring in a declaration in case the `Statements_Only'
     rule parameter is given

This rule may have the following parameters for the `+R' option:

`N'
     `N' is an integer literal used as the maximal value that is not
     flagged (i.e., integer literals not exceeding this value are
     allowed)

`ALL'
     All integer literals are flagged

`Statements_Only'
     Numeric literals are flagged only when used in statements

If no parameters are set, the maximum unflagged value is 1, and the
check for literals is not limited by statements only.

The last specified check limit (or the fact that there is no limit at
all) is used when multiple `+R' options appear.

The `-R' option for this rule has no parameters.  It disables the rule
and restores its default operation mode.  If the `+R' option
subsequently appears, will be 1, and the check will not be limited by
statements only.

     occur last

Only the first violation of the described order is flagged.

The following constructs are checked:

8.2.25 `Raising_Predefined_Exceptions'
--------------------------------------

Flag each `raise' statement that raises a predefined exception (i.e.,
one of the exceptions `Constraint_Error', `Numeric_Error',
`Program_Error', `Storage_Error', or `Tasking_Error').

This rule has no parameters.


File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Unassigned_OUT_Parameters,  Next: Unconstrained_Array_Returns,  Prev: Raising_Predefined_Exceptions,  Up: Feature Usage Rules

8.2.26 `Unassigned_OUT_Parameters'
----------------------------------

Flag procedures' `out' parameters that are not assigned.

An `out' parameter is flagged if the `sequence of statements' of the
procedure body (before the procedure body's exception part, if any)
contains no assignment to the parameter.

An `out' parameter is flagged in an `exception handler' in the exception
part of the procedure body, if the `exception handler' contains neither
an assignment to the parameter nor a raise statement.

Bodies of generic procedures are also considered.

The following are treated as assignments to an `out' parameter:

   * an assignment statement, with the parameter or some component as
     the target

   * passing the parameter (or one of its components) as an `out' or
     `in out' parameter, except for the case when it is passed to the
     call of an attribute subprogram.

This rule has no parameters.

     Warning: This rule only detects a trivial case of an unassigned
     variable and doesn't provide a guarantee that there is no
     uninitialized access.  The rule does not check function parameters
     (starting from Ada 2012 functions can have `out' parameters). It
     is not a replacement for rigorous check for uninitialized access
     provided by advanced static analysis tools.

8.2.27 `Unconstrained_Array_Returns'
------------------------------------

Flag each function returning an unconstrained array. Function
declarations, function bodies (and body stubs) having no separate
specifications, and generic function instantiations are flagged.
Function calls and function renamings are not flagged.

Generic function declarations, and function declarations in generic
packages, are not flagged.  Instead, this rule flags the results of
generic instantiations (that is, expanded specification and expanded
body corresponding to an instantiation).

This rule has the following (optional) parameters for the `+R' option:

`Except_String'
     Do not flag functions that return the predefined `String' type or
     a type derived from it, directly or indirectly.

8.3 Metrics-Related Rules
=========================

The rules in this section can be used to enforce compliance with
specific code metrics, by checking that the metrics computed for a
program lie within user-specifiable bounds.  Depending on the metric,
there may be a lower bound, an upper bound, or both.  A construct is
flagged if the value of the metric exceeds the upper bound or is less
than the lower bound.

The name of any metrics rule consists of the prefix `Metrics_' followed
by the name of the corresponding metric: `Essential_Complexity',
`Cyclomatic_Complexity', or `LSLOC'.  (The 'LSLOC' acronym stands for
'Logical Source Lines Of Code'.)  The meaning and the computed values
of the metrics are the same as in `gnatmetric'.

For the `+R' option, each metrics rule has a numeric parameter
specifying the bound (integer or real, depending on a metric).  The `-R'
option for the metrics rules does not have a parameter.

`Example:' the rule

    +RMetrics_Cyclomatic_Complexity : 7

means that all bodies with cyclomatic complexity exceeding 7 will be
flagged.

To turn OFF the check for cyclomatic complexity metric, use the
following option:

    -RMetrics_Cyclomatic_Complexity

8.3.1 `Metrics_Essential_Complexity'
------------------------------------

The `Metrics_Essential_Complexity' rule takes a positive integer as
upper bound.  A program unit that is an executable body exceeding this
limit will be flagged.

The Ada essential complexity metric is a McCabe cyclomatic complexity
metric counted for the code that is reduced by excluding all the pure
structural Ada control statements.

8.3.2 `Metrics_Cyclomatic_Complexity'
-------------------------------------

The `Metrics_Cyclomatic_Complexity' rule takes a positive integer as
upper bound.  A program unit that is an executable body exceeding this
limit will be flagged.

The McCabe cyclomatic complexity metric is defined in
<http://www.mccabe.com/pdf/mccabe-nist235r.pdf> The goal of cyclomatic
complexity metric is to estimate the number of independent paths in the
control flow graph that in turn gives the number of tests needed to
satisfy paths coverage testing completeness criterion.

program unit declaration or a program unit body exceeding this limit
will be flagged.

The metric counts the total number of declarations and the total number
of statements.

File: gnatcheck_rm.info,  Node: Annotated_Comments,  Next: Boolean_Relational_Operators,  Up: SPARK Ada Rules

8.4.1 `Annotated_Comments'
--------------------------

Flags comments that are used as annotations or as special
sentinels/markers. Such comments have the following structure

    --<special_character> <comment_marker>

where

`<special_character>'
     character (such as '#', '$', '|' etc.) indicating that the comment
     is used for a specific purpose

`<comment_marker>'
     a word identifying the annotation or special usage (word here is
     any sequence of characters except white space)

There may be any amount of white space (including none at all) between
`<special_character>' and `<comment_marker>', but no white space is
permitted between `'--'' and `<special_character>'. (A white space here
is either a space character or horizontal tabulation)

`<comment_marker>' must not contain any white space.

`<comment_marker>' may be empty, in which case the rule flags each
comment that starts with `--<special_character>' and that does not
contain any other character except white space

The rule has the following (mandatory) parameter for the `+R' option:

`S'
     String with the following interpretation: the first character is
     the special comment character, and the rest is the comment marker.
     S must not contain white space.

The `-R' option erases all definitions of special comment annotations
specified by the previous +R options.

The rule is case-sensitive.

Example:

The rule

    +RAnnotated_Comments:#hide

will flag the following comment lines

    --#hide
    --# hide
    --#           hide

       I := I + 1; --# hide

But the line

    -- # hide

will not be flagged, because of the space between '-' and '#'.

The line

    --#Hide

will not be flagged, because the string parameter is case sensitive.

8.4.2 `Boolean_Relational_Operators'
------------------------------------

Flag each call to a predefined relational operator ('<', '>', '<=',
'>=', '=' and '/=') for the predefined Boolean type.  (This rule is
useful in enforcing the SPARK language restrictions.)

Calls to predefined relational operators of any type derived from
`Standard.Boolean' are not detected.  Calls to user-defined functions
with these designators, and uses of operators that are renamings of the
predefined relational operators for `Standard.Boolean', are likewise
not detected.

array definition, or `for'-loop parameter specification, and whose
bounds are both of type `universal_integer'. Ranges that have at least
one bound of a specific type (such as `1 .. N', where `N' is a variable
or an expression of non-universal type) are not flagged.

9 Example of `gnatcheck' Usage
******************************

Here is a simple example. Suppose that in the current directory we have
a project file named `gnatcheck_example.gpr' with the following content:

    project Gnatcheck_Example is

       for Source_Dirs use ("src");
       for Object_Dir use "obj";
       for Main use ("main.adb");

       package Check is
          for Default_Switches ("ada") use ("-rules", "-from=coding_standard");
       end Check;

    end Gnatcheck_Example;

And the file named `coding_standard' is also located in the current
directory and has the following content:

    -----------------------------------------------------
    -- This is a sample gnatcheck coding standard file --
    -----------------------------------------------------

    --  First, turning on rules, that are directly implemented in gnatcheck
    +RAbstract_Type_Declarations
    +RAnonymous_Arrays
    +RLocal_Packages
    +RFloat_Equality_Checks
    +REXIT_Statements_With_No_Loop_Name

    --  Then, activating compiler checks of interest:
    +RStyle_Checks:e
    --  This style check checks if a unit name is present on END keyword that
    --  is the end of the unit declaration

And the subdirectory `src' contains the following Ada sources:

`pack.ads':

    package Pack is
       type T is abstract tagged private;
       procedure P (X : T) is abstract;

       package Inner is
          type My_Float is digits 8;
          function Is_Equal (L, R : My_Float) return Boolean;
       end Inner;
    private
       type T is abstract tagged null record;
    end;

`pack.adb':

    package body Pack is
       package body Inner is
          function Is_Equal (L, R : My_Float) return Boolean is
          begin
             return L = R;
          end;
       end Inner;
    end Pack;

and `main.adb'

    with Pack; use Pack;
    procedure Main is

       pragma Annotate
         (gnatcheck, Exempt_On, "Anonymous_Arrays", "this one is fine");
       Float_Array : array (1 .. 10) of Inner.My_Float;
       pragma Annotate (gnatcheck, Exempt_Off, "Anonymous_Arrays");

       Another_Float_Array : array (1 .. 10) of Inner.My_Float;

       use Inner;

       B : Boolean := False;

    begin
       for J in Float_Array'Range loop
          if Is_Equal (Float_Array (J), Another_Float_Array (J)) then
             B := True;
             exit;
          end if;
       end loop;
    end Main;

And suppose we call `gnatcheck' from the current directory using the
project file as the only parameter of the call:

    gnatcheck -Pgnatcheck_example.gpr

As a result, `gnatcheck' is called to check all the files from the
project `gnatcheck_example.gpr' using the coding standard defined by
the file `coding_standard'. The `gnatcheck' report file named
`gnatcheck.out' will be created in the `obj' directory, and it will
have the following content:

*********************************

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

Copyright  2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008  Free Software Foundation, Inc
<http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

`Preamble'

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

`1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS'

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The `Document', below, refers
to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
and is addressed as "`you'".  You accept the license if you copy,
modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
copyright law.

A "`Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "`Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The "`Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "`Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may be
at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "`Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,
and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy
that is not "Transparent" is called `Opaque'.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "`Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "`publisher'" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "`Entitled XYZ'" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "`Acknowledgements'",
"`Dedications'", "`Endorsements'", or "`History'".)  To "`Preserve the
Title'" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it
remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.

`2. VERBATIM COPYING'

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

`3. COPYING IN QUANTITY'

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the
full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
You may add other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of
the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using public
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

`4. MODIFICATIONS'

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of
it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
     from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
     (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
     of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
     if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
     Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
     the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
     five), unless they release you from this requirement.

  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
     Version, as the publisher.

  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.

  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
     giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
     terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

  G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
     notice.

  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

  I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and
     add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
     and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create
     one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
     Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing
     the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
     public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
     the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
     it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
     You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
     least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
     publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

  K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
     Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.

  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
     their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent
     are not considered part of the section titles.

  M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may
     not be included in the Modified Version.

  N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
     or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

  O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you
may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

`5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS'

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any
sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections Entitled
"Endorsements".

`6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS'

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

`7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS'

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  When
the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply
to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

`8. TRANSLATION'

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
Invariant Sections.  You may include a translation of this License, and
all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
provided that you also include the original English version of this
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In
case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

`9. TERMINATION'

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

`10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE'

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be
used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

`11. RELICENSING'

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

`ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents'

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

     Copyright © YEAR  YOUR NAME.  Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant
     Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy
     of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
     Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with ... Texts." line with this:

     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
     LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
