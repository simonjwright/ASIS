.. index:: Templates (for ASIS applications)

The subdirectory :file:`templates` of the ASIS distribution contains a set of
Ada source components that can be used as templates for developing simple ASIS
applications. The general idea is that you can easily build an ASIS
application by adding the code performing some specific ASIS analysis in
well-defined places in these templates.

Refer to the ASIS tutorial's solutions for examples of the use of the
templates.

For more information see the :file:`README` file in the :file:`templates`
subdirectory.
