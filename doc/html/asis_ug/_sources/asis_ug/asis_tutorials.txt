.. index:: ASIS Tutorials

The subdirectory :file:`tutorial` of the ASIS distribution contains a simple
hands-on ASIS tutorial which may be useful in getting a quick start with
ASIS. The tutorial contains a set of simple exercises based on the ``asistant`` tool
and on a set of the ASIS Application Templates provided as a part of the ASIS
distribution. The complete solutions are provided for all the exercises, so the
tutorial may also be considered as a set of ASIS examples.

For more information see the :file:`README` file in the :file:`tutorial`
subdirectory.
