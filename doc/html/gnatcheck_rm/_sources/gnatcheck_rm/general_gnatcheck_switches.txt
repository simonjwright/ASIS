****************************
General *gnatcheck* Switches
****************************

The following switches control the general *gnatcheck* behavior


  .. index:: --version


``--version``
  Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other options.

  .. index:: --help


``--help``
  Display usage, then exit disregarding all other options.

  .. index:: -P file


``-P file``
  Indicates the name of the project file that describes the set of sources
  to be processed. The exact set of argument sources depends on other options
  specified, see below.

  .. index:: -U


``-U``
  If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
  specified (either directly or by means of ``-files`` option), process
  all the units of the closure of the argument project. Otherwise this option
  has no effect.

  .. index:: -U main_unit


``-U main_unit``
  If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
  specified (either directly or by means of ``-files`` option), process
  the closure of units rooted at `main_unit`. Otherwise this option
  has no effect.

  .. index:: -Xname=value


``-Xname=value``
  Indicates that external variable `name` in the argument project
  has the `value` value. Has no effect if no project is specified as
  tool argument.

  .. index:: --subdirs=dir


``--subdirs=dir``
  Use the specified subdirectory of the project objects file (or of the
  project file directory if the project does not specify an object directory)
  for tool output files. Has no effect if no project is specified as
  tool argument or if ``--no_objects_dir`` is specified.

  .. index:: --no_objects_dir


``--no_objects_dir``
  Place all the result files into the current directory instead of
  project objects directory.

  .. index:: --RTS=rts-path


``--RTS=rts-path``
  Specifies the default location of the runtime library. Same meaning as the
  equivalent *gnatmake* flag (see GNAT User's Guide).

  .. index:: -a


``-a``
  Process all units including those with read-only ALI files such as
  those from the GNAT Run-Time library.


``--incremental``
  .. index:: --incremental gnatpp

  Incremental processing on a per-file basis. Source files are only
  processed if they have been modified, or if files they depend on have
  been modified. This is similar to the way gnatmake/gprbuild only
  compiles files that need to be recompiled. A project file is required
  in this mode, and the gnat driver (as in *gnat check*) is not
  supported.  Note that rules requiring a global analysis
  (Recursive_Subprograms, Deeply_Nested_Inlining) are not supported in
  --incremental mode.

  .. index:: -h


``-h``
  List all the rules checked by the given *gnatcheck* version.

  .. index:: -j


``-j``\ nnnn
  Use *nnnn* processes to carry out the tree creations (internal
  representations of the argument sources). On a multiprocessor machine
  this speeds up processing of big sets of argument sources.
  If `n` is 0, then the maximum number of parallel tree creations is
  the number of core processors on the platform.

  .. index:: -l


``-l``
  Use full source locations references in the report file. For a construct from
  a generic instantiation a full source location is a chain from the location
  of this construct in the generic unit to the place where this unit is
  instantiated.

  .. index:: -log


``-log``
  Duplicate all the output sent to :file:`stderr` into a log file. The log file
  is named :file:`gnatcheck.log`. If a project file is specified as
  *gnatcheck*
  parameter then it is located in the project objects directory (or in the
  project file directory if no object directory is specified). Otherwise
  it is located in the current directory.

  .. index:: -m


``-m``\ nnnn
  Maximum number of diagnostics to be sent to :file:`stdout`, where *nnnn* is in
  the range 0...1000;
  the default value is 500. Zero means that there is no limitation on
  the number of diagnostic messages to be output.

  .. index:: -q


``-q``
  Quiet mode. All the diagnostics about rule violations are placed in the
  *gnatcheck* report file only, without duplication on :file:`stdout`.

  .. index:: -s


``-s``
  Short format of the report file (no version information, no list of applied
  rules, no list of checked sources is included)

  .. index:: -xml


``-xml``
  Generate the report file in XML format. Is not allowed in incremental mode.

  .. index:: -nt


``-nt``
  Do not generate the report file in text format. Enforces  ``-xml``,
  is not allowed in incremental mode.


  .. index:: -files


``-files=filename``
    Take the argument source files from the specified file. This file should be an
    ordinary text file containing file names separated by spaces or
    line breaks. You can use this switch more than once in the same call to
    *gnatcheck*. You also can combine this switch with
    an explicit list of files.



  .. index:: --show-rule


``--show-rule``
  Add the corresponding rule name to the diagnosis generated for its
  violation.

  .. index:: --include-file=file


``--include-file=file``
  Append the content of the specified text file to the report file

  .. index:: -t


``-t``
  Print out execution time.

  .. index:: -v


``-v``
  Verbose mode; *gnatcheck* generates version information and then
  a trace of sources being processed.

  .. index:: -o


``-o report_file``
  Set name of the text report file to `report_file`.

  .. index:: -ox


``-ox report_file``
  Set name of the XML report file to `report_file`. Enforces  ``-xml``,
  is not allowed in incremental mode.

  .. index:: --write-rules


``--write-rules=template_file``
  Write to `template_file` the template rule file that contains all the rules
  currently implemented in *gnatcheck* turned off. A user may edit this
  template file manually to get his own coding standard file.


If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
specified (either directly or by means of ``-files`` option), and no
``-U`` is specified, then the set of processed sources is
all the immediate units of the argument project.
