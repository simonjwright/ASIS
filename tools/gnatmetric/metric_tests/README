This directory contains test examples for the metrics implemented in
gnatmetric. These examples are organized on per-metric basis, each test example
is supposed to demonstrate one specific metric.

All the units that make up a test example for a a given metric are organised
in a hierarchy with the top package that has the same name as the metric
itself.

In the test units, each construct for which the metric should be computed,
is marked by the comment

'--  EXPECTED METRIC VALUE: NNN'
