        GNAT2XML
        ========

   GNAT2XML is based upon work supported by the U.S. Air Force
   Office of Scientific Research, funded through Kansas State University,
   under Award No. FA9550-09-0138.

'gnat2xml' takes Ada source code as input, and produces XML that conforms to
the schema, which is in ada-schema.xsd. User documentation may be found in the
GNAT Pro User's Guide, under "The Ada-to-XML converter `gnat2xml'".

Building Gnat2xml
=================

First install the GNAT compiler, ASIS, and xmlada in the usual way (see
instructions for those tools). You should use the latest wavefront
version of GNAT.

Set your ADA_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable to include the
directories where gnat and asis are installed.

Unpack the source distribution.

In the gnat2xml directory, type:

    make all test

'all' will build two executables, gnat2xsd and gnat2xml,
and run gnat2xsd to generate a new schema, which should
be identical to the existing schema.

'test' will run gnat2xml on some test cases, validate the output using
xmllint, and compare against expected results.

Success is indicated by 'make' returning a zero exit status.

To see some examples of XML files generated by gnat2xml, look in
gnat2xml/stage/1/xml.  Alternatively, look in
gnat2xml/stage/1/compact-xml, which is the --compact version, which is more
readable, but does not validate, so is not suitable for XML-reading
programs.
