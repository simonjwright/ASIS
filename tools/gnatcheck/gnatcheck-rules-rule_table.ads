--  This package defines the table for storing rules to be checked by
--  gnatcheck. For any rule the only means to get into this table is the
--  call to the Register_Rule procedure

with GNAT.Table;

package Gnatcheck.Rules.Rule_Table is

   function No      (Id : Rule_Id) return Boolean;
   function Present (Id : Rule_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Check if the argument represents an existing rule

   procedure Process_Rule_Option
     (Option     : String;
      Defined_At : String);
   --  Processes the rule option taken from the command line or from rule file.
   --
   --  The following options are supported:
   --
   --  +ALL                 - turn all the rules ON
   --  +GLOBAL              - turn all the global rules ON (temporary
   --                         undocumented feature)
   --  -ALL                 - turn all the rules OFF
   --  -GLOBAL              - turn all the global rules OFF (temporary
   --                         undocumented feature)
   --  +R<rule_id>[:params] - turn ON the given rule [for the given parameters
   --                         values]
   --  -R<rule_id>[:params] - turn OFF the given rule [for the given parameters
   --                         values]. At the moment the rule parameter
   --                         for -R option is not implemented, and -R option
   --                         with parameters is just ignored
   --
   --  params is a list of strings separated by a comma. No space character is
   --  allowed next to ':' or to ','.
   --
   --  <rule_id> should be the name (identifier) of a rule that is currently
   --  implemented in gnatcheck, casing is not important
   --
   --  If the actual does not correspond to any of these formats, or if
   --  <rule_id> does not correspond to any of the rules currently implemented
   --  in gnatcheck, the warning message is generated and nothing is changed in
   --  the state of the currently implemented rules
   --
   --  Defined_At should be set to an empty string when processing the rule
   --  option from a command line, or to the short name of the rule file.

   procedure Process_Rule_File (RF_Name : String);
   --  Processes a set of rule options stored in the rule configuration file.
   --  RF_Name is the name of this rule file.
   --
   --  If file with this name does not exist, the corresponding warning message
   --  is generated.
   --
   --  The rule file may contain empty lines, Ada-style comment lines and lines
   --  containing the rule options, Rule options written in the rule file have
   --  the same syntax as rule options given in the command line (see the
   --  documentation for Process_Rule_Option, except that +/-GLOBAL rule
   --  option is not allowed in the rule configuration file), but they can be
   --  written in the free format, that is:
   --
   --  - a rule option can be written in several lines, with the spaces between
   --    the component of the rule options
   --
   --  - end-of-line (Ada-style) comments may be used
   --
   --  Each rule option in the rule file should start from a new line.
   --
   --  For any problem detected when parsing the rule file the corresponding
   --  warning message is generated. Any part of the rule file that can not be
   --  interpreted as an empty line, a comment line or a rule option is
   --  ignored. Any rule option that does not satisfy the requirements stated
   --  in the description of the rule options in documentation of
   --  Process_Rule_Option is also ignored.

   procedure Rules_Help;
   --  Outputs into Stderr the help info for all the rules currently
   --  implemented in gnatcheck. This procedure does not know about rule
   --  categories and prints out a flat rule list.

   function Get_Rule (Rule_Name : String) return Rule_Id;
   --  Returns the Id for the rule registered under the name Rule_Name or
   --  corresponding to the compiler check denoted by Rule_Name. If there is no
   --  such rule, returns No_Rule. Rule names are not case-sensitive.

   procedure Activate_Rules_In_Test_Mode;
   --  Turns ON all the rules with Fully_Implemented status that are currently
   --  implemented in gnatcheck. If a rule requires a parameter, some
   --  reasonable parameter value is used. Is supposed for massive gnatcheck
   --  testing with Q4A only!
   --  For now, this procedure does not activate compiler checks.

   procedure Turn_All_Global_Rules_On;
   --  Turns ON all the global rules currently implemented in gnatcheck

   --  Sets the state of the argument rule. Requires Present (For_Rule)

   function Rule_Name (R : Rule_Id) return String;
   --  Returns the name of the rule.

   function Is_Enabled (Rule : Rule_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Checks if the argument is enabled (works for compiler checks as well).
   --  Assumes Present (Rule), otherwise raises Fatal_Error.

   function Is_Global (Rule : Rule_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Checks if the argument is a global rule. Assumes Present (Rule),
   --  otherwise raises Fatal_Error.

   function Rule_Status (R : Rule_Id) return Rule_Statuses;
   --  Return the status of the argument rule. Assumes that Present (R).

   function Parent_Category (R : Rule_Id) return Category_Id;
   --  Returns the parent category for the rule

   function Get_Next_Rule
     (R           : Rule_Id;
      From_Status : Rule_Statuses := Fully_Implemented)
      return        Rule_Id;
   --  Returns the rule Id for the rule that follows R in the corresponding
   --  category and has status equal to or greater than From_Status. Returns
   --  No_Rule if R is the last rule in category.

   procedure Print_Rule_List
     (First_Rule  : Rule_Id;
      Level       : Natural;
      From_Status : Rule_Statuses);
   --  Prints out a list rules that starts from First_Rule and contains rules
   --  belonging to the same category and having the status not less than
   --  From_Status. Level indicates the indentation level in the output.
   --  It is supposed that R also has the status not less than From_Status.
