   --  combination of Enable value) is not allowed for a given rule, this
   --  procedure should generate an error message (saying that the given
   --  parameter is ignored for a given rule) and does not do anything
   --  else.
   --
   --  Defined_At is used to store the place where the rule for the given
   --  parameter has been defined for the last time. It may be used to from a

   --  SLOC file:line:columm if the rule with this parameter is defined in a
   --  rule file, or whould be empty if the rule option is given in a command
   --  line. (The following situation may be treated as a rule parameter
   --  redefinition: the rule is enabled with the value 'Val1' for parameter
   --  'Par1' and then it is enabled again with some (different or the same)
   --  value for this parameter. This looks suspicious and may result in
   --  warning. The decisions wether or not a warning should be issued in this
   --  sutuation are made on rule-by-rule basis. The case when the rule is
   --  enabled, then disabled and then enabled again does not result in
   --  a warning.)

   --  The template does the following:
   --  - if Param string is empty, it sets the rule ON or OFF depending on the
   --    value of the Enable parameter;
