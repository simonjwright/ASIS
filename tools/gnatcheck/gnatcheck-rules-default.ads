   -- Limited_Renamings --
   -----------------------

   --  This rule combines a part of the SPARK limitations imposed on renamings.
   --  It is formulated for renaming declarations only, not for the use of
   --  renamed entities. The following situations should be detected:

   --  Syntax of renaming declarations: all forms of  renaming declarations
   --  except package and subprogram renaming declarations should be detected.

   --  Renamed entities: only subprograms declared immediately within package
   --  specs and only child packages can be renamed. All other cases of
   --  subprogram and package renamings should be detected.

   --  Limitations on new and old names: the name after RENAMES should have
   --  the form package_name.entity_name, the new name should be exactly the
   --  same as entity_name, entity_name should not itself be detected by a
   --  renaming declaration. Moreover, in case of a subprogram renaming, the
   --  new and the old profiles should be the same (the same parameter and
   --  subtype names should be used). All the renamings that do not follow
   --  these rules should be detected.

   --  Placement of renamings. According to the definition of SPARK, the
   --  following restrictions are imposed on the placement of renaming
   --  declarations:
   --
   --  for subprogram renamings (that are not operator renamings):
   --  - if the package where the subprogram is declared is a local package,
   --    renaming is allowed immediately after the declaration of this
   --    package;
   --  - if the package where the subprogram is declared is a library-level
   --    package, renaming is allowed at the start of the body of a library
   --    package (or library subprogram) that "withes" this package;
   --
   --  for operator renamings: the same is allowed as for subprogram renamings
   --  plus renamings are allowed at the start of the visible or private part
   --  of the library package that "withes" the package where the operator is
   --  declared;
   --
   --  for package renamings: the renaming of a (child!) package is allowed
   --  only immediately within a library package or library subprogram that
   --  "withes" this package;
   --
   --  All the other cases of renaming declaration placement should be
   --  detected.
   --
   --  Note that the rules about allowed renaming placement are taken from the
   --  definition of the SPARK subset. This definition uses the following
   --  wording: "at the start of the body", "at the start of the visible
   --  (private) part", and it the same time the SPARK book contains examples
   --  where an (allowed) renaming follows an object declaration. So we do
   --  not check that renamings precede all the non-renaming declarations.

   --  All the things stated above are checked and detected in the order given.
   --  If some feature is detected for a renaming declaration, all the other
   --  things are not checked for this renaming declaration

   --  Current implementation limitation: an the moment this rule is not
   --  completely checked for renaming of predefined operators.
