------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--  This package contains high-level interfaces to project files. These
--  interfaces are supposed to be enough to extract all the information an
--  [ASIS-based] tool may need from the argument project file.
--
--  A part of project file processing is tool-specific: there are tool-specific
--  packages and parameters in the project file, so this package defines only
--  the common steps needed for extracting the information from the project
--  file by providing the Arg_Project_Type type. A tool has to extend this
--  type by providing operations for dealing with tool-specific attributes.
--
--  The interface provided here assumes that a tool is based on the Source
--  Table defined in ASIS_UL.Source_Table.
--
--  The recommended way of project file processing is:
--
--  Two main steps of processing the project file that is the tool argument
--  should be done:
--
--  (a) analyzing the project file as a part of the analysis of the tool
--      command line arguments. At this stage the following information is
--      supposed to be extracted and stored in the tool data structures:
--
--      * options to be used to call gcc to create tree files;
--      * tool-specific options;
--      * a list of argument sources (in case when a tool is called without
--        argument sources, that means that all the sources of the project
--        should be processed);
--
--  (b) creating the mapping file for the project sources and storing the
--      compilation options that are specific for the argument sources.
--
--  The important thing is that when a project file is provided as a tool
--  parameter, the tool cannot use any source search path to locate sources and
--  to form the set of options (-I options or placing the source search path
--  into an environment variable) for gcc call.
--
--  The general tool architecture implemented in the ASIS Utility Library
--  defines the following sequence of tool initialization:
--
--  (1) tool parameters are analyzed and stored, at this stage the tool
--      argument files are stored in some temporary storage, but not in the
--      source table;
--
--  (2) a check is made that the set of tool options is consistent, and if
--      it is, the argument sources are moved from the temporary storage into
--      the source table, and at this stage it is checked that a source to be
--      placed in the source table exists, and that there is no duplication
--      in the set of argument sources. As a result, the source table
--      contains only existing sources with no duplication.
--
--  ???
--  The step (a) above is a part of the step (1) of the general tool
--  initialization, but the step (b) can be done only when we have a list of
--  the existing argument files with no duplications, so it is performed as a
--  part of step (2) *after* moving the argument files into the source table.
--  This is why there are basically two places in the tool code that is
--  responsible for the project file processing.
--  ???
--
--  To represent the project file provided as a tool parameter, we define the
--  Arg_Project_Type (that is derived from GNATCOLL.Projects.Project_Tree. In
--  the specification below the primitives of this type are separated into
--  three groups:
--  * operations that hardly need redefinition for a tool;
--  * operations that may need redefinition for a tool;
--  * operations that for sure need redefinition for a tool;
--
--  It is supposed that a tool may have at most one project file as its
--  argument, so it can be only one object of a tool-specific descendant of the
--  Arg_Project_Type declared in the tool code.
--
--  *** Processing tool parameters ***
--
--  If a tool can accept a project file as an argument, we have to process tool
--  command line parameters twice and in between we have to process the project
--  file. The reason is that tool options may be specified both on the command
--  line and in the tool-specific package of the project file, and the
--  resulting list of options to be applied to the tool should be the
--  superposition of the options from the project file and from the command
--  line in the following order:
--
--   <options from project file><options from command line>
--
--  So, the processing of the tool parameters should be a sequence of three
--  steps:
--
--  1. Scan the command-line parameters, but store only the following
--     information:
--     * project-specific options (-P, -U, -X, -vP)
--     * '--help' and '--version'
--     * argument sources (specified either directly or by any other means,
--       for example as '--files=list_of_arg_sources.txt'
--       where list_of_arg_sources.txt is a text file containing the names of
--       the argument sources
--
--  2. If at the first step either '--help' or '--version' option is detected,
--     print out the corresponding information and exit from the tool. Else if
--     at the first step '-P prj' option is detected, analyze the project file
--     prj (taking into account all the other project-specific options). This
--     includes extracting the tool options, compilation parameters for
--     creating tree files and argument sources (if needed).
--
--  3. Scan again the command-line parameters, but this time ignore all the
--     options listed in paragraph 1 above, but store all the other options.
--     This gives the required superposition of the options specified in the
--     project file and in the command line.
--
--  The proposed implementation of the project support relies on the following:
--
--  * All the tool-specific options in a project file are given in a
--    tool-specific package;
--  * This tool-specific package can contain two attributes - Default_Switches
--    indexed by "ada" and Switches indexed by the names of Ada sources;
--  * The list of values of these attributes has exactly the same structure
--    as the list of options and arguments in the command line tool call with
--    the following exceptions:
--    - no project-specific option is allowed;
--    - '--help' and '--version' options are not allowed
--    - Switches attribute cannot have argument sources as its values
--      (specified either directly or by a list of sources)
--
--  As a result, the same scanner is used to process the command line and the
--  values of the attributes Default_Switches and Switches - this is the
--  operation Scan_Arguments of Arg_Project_Type that has to be defined for
--  each tool. This procedure with the appropriate command line parser and
--  boolean parameters that indicate the case of ins usage) implements steps 1
--  and 3 above. For step 2, see the class-wide procedure Process_Project_File
--  that combines all the steps of loading and analyzing the project file.
--
--  Procedure Set_Individual_Source_Options stores compilation attributes
--  specific for individual sources. It should be called (immediately) after
--  moving all the argument sources into the source table.
