   --  format;

   --  Prints into Stderr the tool version information in the following format:
   --
   --  <toolname>
   --  Copyright <Released_At>-<current year>, AdaCore.
   --
   --  Released_At is supposed to be the year when the tool is first released.

   procedure Print_Tool_Version (Released_At : Positive);
   --  Similar to Print_Version_Info, but sends the output into Stdout and
   --  the format of the information printed is similar to what is printed
   --  for '--version' option by all the other GNAT tools.

   procedure Report_Unhandled_ASIS_Exception (Ex : Exception_Occurrence);
   --  Reports an unhandled ASIS exception into Standard_Error

   procedure Report_Unhandled_Exception (Ex : Exception_Occurrence);
   --  Reports an unhandled non-ASIS exception into Standard_Error

   procedure Error (Message : String);
   --  Sends into Stderr the error message in the form 'Tool_Name: Message'

   procedure Error_No_Tool_Name (Message : String);
   --  Sends into Stderr the error message with no tool name prefix

      Elem    : Asis.Element);
   procedure SLOC_Error
     (Message : String;
      SLOC    : String);
   --  Sends to Stderr the error message in the following format:
   --  'SLOC:Tool_Name:Message', where SLOC is the GNAT-style sourse location.
   --  For the first procedure, SLOC is computed for argument Elem and the
   --  caller is responsible for providing actual Elements for that SLOC can
   --  successfully be computed. For the second procedure SLOC should be
   --  provided by the caller.
   --
   --  This procedure should be used in case when the generated message is
   --  supposed to be parsed by GPS.

   procedure Warning (Message : String);
   --  Same as Error, but do nothing if Warning_Mode = Quiet.

   procedure Warning_No_Tool_Name (Message : String);

   --  Sends Message as a separate line(s) into Stderr (with no tool name
   --  prefix). If Line_Len is set to some positive value, it is treated as a
   --  maximal length of the text to be placed into one output line, and if the
   --  length of Message exceeds Line_Len, this procedure tries to split
   --  Message treating spaces as word separators and prints the rest of the
   --  Message on the next line(s). Each continuation line starts from Spacing
   --  number of space characters. Message can be split only on borders of
   --  words.
