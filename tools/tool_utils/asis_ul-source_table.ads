   --  - This routine checks if we have already stored a file with the same
   --    short(!) name. If we already have such a file, it generates a
   --    warning message (if Duplication_Report is set ON) and does nothing
   --    else.
   --
   --    Note that ASIS_UL.Common.Use_Project_File_Obsolete corresponds to the
   --    very old partial implementation of the project support for ASIS tools,
   --    we keep it for compatibility reasons only (AJIS???). It should not be
   --    used by any new tool.
   --
   --  If ASIS_UL.Common.Use_Project_File_Obsolete is set OFF:
   --
   --  - First, this routine checks if Fname is the name of some existing file,
   --    and if it is not, generates the corresponding diagnosis and does
   --    nothing more. If Arg_Project represents a project file being a tool
   --    parameter, it uses the corresponding project to check the file
   --    existence (no source search path should be used in this case!).
   --    Otherwise this procedure takes into account the search path for the
   --    Ada sources only if ASIS_UL.Compiler_Options.Source_Search_Path is
   --    set, otherwise it just calls GNAT.OS_Lib.Is_Readable_File (Fname)
   --    and checks the result.
   --
   --  - Then, it checks if we already have stored a file with the same name.
   --    If we have the file with the same name, but from a different
   --    directory, a warning is generated, but the file is added to the file
   --    table (the situation when the metric tool is called to process files
   --    with the same name but from different directories looks strange, but
   --    this may be quite legal and reasonable). But if we have already stored
   --    in the list the name of exactly the same file, we generate the error
   --    message and do not change anything in the list of files.
   --
   --  At this stage we do not know if Fname denotes a compilable Ada source
   --  file.
   --
   --  This procedure tries to detect if this source is the source of a
   --  body unit, and if so, stores this in the corresponding record of the
   --  source table. To define this, it checks the suffix of the file name.
   --  It treats suffixes '.adb' and '.2.ada' as suffixes of body files.
