[All the readme files from the 'tutorial' subdirectory should be converted
into the corresponding sections of the ASIS Users Guide]

This is the top directory for ASIS tutorial.

This tutorial consists of two parts:

1. Playing around with ASIS queries using the asistant tool (subdirectory
   using_asistant)

   This part will get you acquainted with the asistant tool and it will
   show you some ASIS queries "in actions". If you are completely new
   to ASIS, you may start from this part to get some feeling of
   what ASIS is and how it works.

2. Building some simple ASIS application from the set of ASIS Application
   templates (subdirectory using_templates).

   This part will show you what are the main "building blocks" of a
   typical ASIS application and how you can build some real application
   using a set of the ASIS Application templates provided by ASIS-for_GNAT.

All the parts of the tutoial contain a task to solve, some hints you
may use when trying to solve the task yourself and an example of the
possible solution. So you may also use this tutorial as a set of
self-explained ASIS examples.
