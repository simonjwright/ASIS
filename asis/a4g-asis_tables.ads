   --  This table contains ASIS Elements. It is supposed to be used only for

   --  many ASIS queries use instantiations of Traverse_Elements to create
   --  result lists, so we have to make sure that ASIS structural queries
   --  used in the implementation of Traverse_Element use another table to
   --  create result lists

   --  representing the same construct in another tree. The trace is also used
   --  to check is two nodes from different trees, each belonging to expanded
   --  generics both denote the same thing. This trace contains the record
   --  about N itself and all the enclosing constructs such as package bodies
   --  and package specs. For the package which is an expanded generic, the
   --  next element in the trace is the corresponding instantiation node.

   function Enclosing_Scope (N : Node_Id) return Node_Id;
   --  Given a node somewhere from expanded generic, returnes its enclosing
   --  "scope" which can be N_Package_Declaration, N_Package_Body or
   --  N_Generic_Declaration node. The idea is to use this function to create
   --  the node trace either for storing it in the Note Trace table or for
   --  creating the trace on the fly to compare it with the stored trace.
