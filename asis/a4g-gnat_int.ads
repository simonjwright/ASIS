-- Scientific  Research  Computer  Center of  Moscow State University (SRCC --

--  This package contains the utility routines used for calling the GNAT
--  compiler from inside the ASIS implementation routines to create a tree
--  file.  These routines may be used by ASIS-based tools as well. The idea is
--  to call GNAT in a black-box manner. The current version of this package
--  borrows most of the ideas and the code patterns from the body of the
--  GNAT Make package (which defines the gnatmake-related routines).
--  Unfortunately, GNAT do not provide the public interface to these
--  routines, so we simply have copied the code from make.adb with some
--  modifications.
--
--  This package also contains the routine which reads the tree file with
--  checking the GNAT-ASIS versions compartibility.
